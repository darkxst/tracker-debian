.SH NAME
trackerd \- indexer daemon for tracker search tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B trackerd [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Trackerd
provides both a powerful indexer and an extensible metadata database. It
indexes files including the text contents and any available metadata to
provide fast search services.
.PP
By default, trackerd will index all files in a user's home directory (with
the exception of hidden files). This can be overridden by specifying
one or more directories to be indexed instead in the configuration file
($HOME/.config/tracker/tracker.cfg) and/or by using the --include-dir
option to specify other directories to be indexed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-?, --help
A brief help message including some examples.

.TP
\-e, --monitors-exclude-dir=/PATH/DIR
Specifies a directory to be excluded from indexing (including all
subdirectories). Can be repeated (-e <path> -e <path>) to exclude 
more than one directory.

.TP
\-i, --monitors-include-dir=/PATH/DIR
Specifies a directory to be included for indexing. All non-hidden
subdirectories of the specified directory will also be indexed. If this
param is set then the user's home directory is no longer indexed by
default (you can still add the home directory with this option).

.TP
\-c, --crawler-include-dirs=/PATH/DIR
Specify directories to crawl. Crawling of directories means index every
indexable content but do not watch for directory or file changes.

.TP
\-n, --disable-indexing
Prevent
.B trackerd
from indexing and watching. Searching is still
possible.

.TP
\-v, --verbosity=value
Makes trackerd log/print more information. Value can be one of 0 - show
only errors, 1 - show only minimal output, 2 - show detailed output and
3 - show debug output (don't do this, unless you know what you are doing).

.TP
\-m, --low-memory
Minimise memory usage. Note that this may slow down indexing.

.TP
\-s, --initial-sleep=value
Set the initial sleep time in seconds. This is the time
.B trackerd
waits at startup before indexing.

.TP
\-l, --language=value
Language to use for stemmer and stop words list (ISO 639-1 2 characters
code).

.TP
\-R, --force-reindex
This forces trackerd to re-index all watched files and directories.
Since every watched directory and any previously indexed file has to be
read and processed again, this may degrade the whole system performance.

.TP
\-f, --fatal-errors
Makes any errors fatal, i.e. forces abortion of
.B trackerd.
This switch is only useful for debugging.
