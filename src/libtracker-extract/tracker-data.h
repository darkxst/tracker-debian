 * @title: How to use libtracker-extract
 * @short_description: The essentials by example
 * @stability: Stable
 * @include: libtracker-extract/tracker-extract.h
 *
 * The libtracker-extract library is the foundation for Tracker
 * metadata extraction of embedded data in files.
 *
 * Tracker comes with extractors written for the most common file
 * types (like MP3, JPEG, PNG, etc.), however, for more special cases,
 * 3rd party applications may want to write their own plugin to
 * extract their own file formats. This documentation describes how to
 * do that.
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Basic extractor example</title>
 * An example of how to write an extractor to retrieve PNG embedded
 * metadata.
 * <programlisting>
 *  /&ast; Set functions to use to extract different mime types. &ast;/
 *  static TrackerExtractData extract_data[] = {
 *          { "image/png",  extract_png },
 *          { "sketch/png", extract_png },
 *          { NULL, NULL }
 *  };

 * tracker_extract_get_metadata:
 * @uri: a string representing a URI.
 * @mimetype: mimetype for the element contained in URI
 * @preupdate: used to populate with data updates that
 *             are a prerequisite for the actual file
 *             metadata insertion.
 * @metadata: used to populate with file metadata predicate/object(s).
 * @where: used for optional WHERE patterns
 *
 * This function must be provided by ALL extractors. This is merely
 * the declaration of the function which must be written by each
 * extractor.
 *
 * This is checked by tracker-extract by looking up the symbols for
 * each started plugin and making sure this function exists.
 *
 * The @metadata parameter is a #TrackerSparqlBuilder constructed
 * through tracker_sparql_builder_new_embedded_insert(), the subject
 * is already set to be the file URN, so implementations of this
 * function should just provide predicate/object(s) pairs. the data
 * triples contained in there at the end of the function will be
 * merged with further file information from miners.
 *
 * Whenever any of the inserted triples rely on entities that
 * should also be provided by this extractor (for example, album
 * or artist information from a song), such insertions should be
 * added to @preupdate, which is a #TrackerSparqlBuilder constructed.
 * through tracker_sparql_builder_new_update().
 *
 * NOTE: If upgrading from 0.10, this function is replacing the old
 * function named tracker_extract_get_data() and has a few subtle
 * differences. First there is a return value for success. Second
 * there is also a @mimetype argument which should will be passed to
 * each extractor.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if the extraction succeeded, %FALSE otherwise.
