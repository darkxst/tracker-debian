  The Deskbar applet packaged with Tracker is currently out of date
  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7.5
============

Improvements / New:

  SPARQL:
  * Fixed to flush update buffer after DROP GRAPH.
  * Fixed leaking variables in reference cycle.
  * Support fts:rank and fts:offsets in function queries.

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed battery handling so we don't throttle indexing when on low
    battery in cases where we are charging on AC power.
  * Fixed logging so that verbosity=1 displays all G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO
    messages. Previously it was unused.
  * Fixed vapi dependencies in Makefile.am
  * Added tracker_info() and tracker_dbus_request_info() to use
    G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO logging.

  libtracker-db:
  * Added tracker_db_statement_bind_null(). This allows use of ?
    parameters in SQL to be set to NULL. No longer special casing NULL
    when used as a value when deleting single valued property values.

  libtracker-data:
  * Fixed crash from dereferencing GError when NULL in
    delete_metadata_decomposed(). 
  * Added a rollback callback to prevent sending update events which
    are rolled back.

  libtracker-fts:
  * Use tracker:weight for per-property weight.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Fixed overwriting throttle in TrackerMinerFiles class
    construction.
  * Fixed TrackerCrawler class vtable definition of ::finished.
  * Fixed g_critical() if .service files are not available for some
    miners (this is the case for the Evolution plugin which is not
    started by D-Bus but Evolution).
  * Fixed tracker_connect() call to disable D-Bus timeouts.

  tracker-store:
  * Compress multiple ClassSignals for predicate-values into a single
    signal.

  tracker-extract:
  * Fixed libstreamanalyzer plugin so it doesn't report file ontology
    information which miner-fs already provides.
  * Fixed configure script so libstreamanalyzer is disabled by default
    but can be forced with --enable-libstreamanalyzer. Previously it
    was just compiled if it was available.
  * Fixed log spamming on start up, based on the fix for NB#126773 for
    0.6. See commit 65adc16dc0183a1a9b08eb85440312399748262a.
  * Fixed missing "break;" when parsing id3v20 tags leading to a
    double free with genre/copyright assignment.
  * Fixed MP3 extractor memory leaks in id3v24 comment tag and tlen
    tag.
  * Fixed so we initialize album art when running stand alone with -f
    command line switch (fixes critical warnings from non-initialized
    caches).
  * Added support for nmm:trackNumber for MP3 extractor. Also uses an
    integer not a string which was leaking too.
  * Added command line switch -i to force in-house extractors over
    libstreamanalyzer.
  * Removed use of g_build_filename() for log filename, instead use the
    string returned by tracker_log_init().

  tracker-control:
  * Created from tracker-processes (which no longer exists).
  * Added support for removing all thumbnails.
  * Added support for removing all config files.
  * Added support for starting Tracker's miners.

  tracker-status:
  * Fixed crash when GValue is NULL when getting status/progress.

  tracker-sparql:
  * Fixed use of '#' and use ':' instead. For example nfo#Video.

  tracker-explorer:
  * Improved UI layout to be more inline with the HIG.

  tracker-status-icon:
  * Added man page for the .cfg file.

  tracker-search-tool:
  * Fixed mimetype query.

Bugs:

  * Fixes NB#120255, Tracker doesn't read "year" tag from the mp3...

  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7.4
============

Improvements / New:

  General:
  * Bumped database schema version (we were not doing this for 0.7.x
    until now) which makes sure a reindex occurs when the database
    schema changes. This is to prevent bugs like: GB#598224.

  Ontology:
  * Added maemo:relevance to provide additional hit scoring.

  SPARQL:
  * Updated to refactor code duplication.
  * Fixed case sensitivity for variables

  Database:
  * Removed EvolutionModseq from the Options table - unused.

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed typo in devicekit low battery functionality, this lead to
    indexing being paused in the wrong conditions.
  * Fixed TrackerConfigFile so inotify CREATE events trigger changed
    signal.

  libtracker-data:
  * Updated to support multiple resources in queries to improve
    performance for specific inserts requests.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Fixed re-index every time tracker-miner-fs was started due to
    mtime query error since introducing timezones.

  tracker-extract:
  * Fixed so words indexed for FTS is based on tracker-fts.cfg, not
    just static at 1000.

  tracker-search-tool:
  * Fixed so only one instance can be run at a time.

  tracker-evolution-plugin:
  * Fixed so we don't spam status updates about the miner.
  * Fixed OOM situation by using D-Bus noreply functions instead.
  * Fixed memory leak when receiving errors from D-Bus responses.
  * Fixed memory leak when processing folders.
  * Fixed progress reporting to go forward not jump around.

Bugs:

  * Fixes GB#570608, Translation of firefox-extension
  * Fixes NB#135969, Artist and Album query returns reults other than...

  and needs some love to get it working with the new APIs. It is in
  the same state as it was for 0.6. As such it isn't expected to work.


NEW in 0.7.3
============

Improvements / New:

  General:

  * Removed requirement for 'sqlite_exec' in configure.ac.

  RSS Reader:
  * Updated Python example to use new Tracker APIs.

  * Improved to not require 'AS' when using SELECT functions. 
  * Support rollback for updates when one or more errors occur.

  libtracker-db:
  * Make sure SQLite statements are reset when using cursors. This was
    leading to DB locks.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Fixed infinite loop when unmounting.
  
  tracker-store:
  * Removed all use of tracker-storage for volume handling. This is
    now done in tracker-miner-fs.

  tracker-preferences:
  * Added visibility options for tracker-search-tool.

  tracker-status-icon:
  * Added tracker-status-icon.cfg for visibility settings.
  * Added global binding to launch tracker-search-tool (<Ctrl><Alt>S).
  * Improved so progress bars are not so tall and the now pulses when
    at 0% (used for crawling or initialising usually).
  * Improved so the progress bar is not displayed for miners not
    running.
  * Fixed so the default progress is 100% (in cases where the
    tracker-status-icon is restarted).

  tracker-search-tool:
  * Fixed UI to be more HIG compliant.

Bugs:

  * Fixes GB#590501, Album art heuristic always fails
  * Fixes NB#137046, Properties Are Not Retained Upon File Modific...

NEW in 0.7.2
============

Improvements / New:

  General:
  * Added support for AM_SILENT_RULES (used for producing nice build
    output), see http://live.gnome.org/GnomeGoals/NicerBuilds
  * Removed filters/ - they are no longer used, was for full text
    search abilities. We now do this in tracker-extract.
  * Simplify CFLAGS/LIBS for applications and generally all Makefiles.

  Ontology:
  * Added average{audio|video}bitrate for nmm:Video. This allows the
    audio and video to have different bit rates in the same URN.
  * Added properties for newly added MTP.
  * Added properties fourCC and waveformat for MTP.
  * Added properties to NMM to support MTP (nmm:lyrics,
    mmm:skipCounter, nmm:isCropped, nmm:isColorCorrected).
  * Added nmm and mto prefixes.
  * Updated mtp:ScanType to subclass nie:InformationElement allowing
    nie:description on instances.
  * Renamed nmm:album to nmm:videoAlbum to be consistent with
    nmm:audioAlbum.

  Test Cases:

  libstemmer:
  * Fix API to return const/non-const more consistently.

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed TrackerConfigFile to make it an abstract type object.
  * Fixed storage (HAL) APIs to return const/non-const more
    consistently.
  * Fixed tracker_path_evaluate_name() so we use the HOME environment
    variable with g_getenv() instead of g_get_home_dir(). This fixes
    issues seen with NFS mounted home directories.
  * Fixed storage (HAL) APIs to normalise directories returned.
  * Fixed timezone test case for tracker-type-utils.
  * Improve documentation.

  libtracker-data:
  * Fixed virtual property tracker:uri.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Added "process-pool-limit" to TrackerMinerFS, this allows us to
    process more than one file at once. Previously each file was
    extracted in tracker-extract and stored in tracker-store
    sequentially. Now data is extracted while it is being stored if
    process-pool-limit is > 1. Now it is set to 10.
  * Added support for deleting recursively when a directory is removed.
  * Updated the documentation.
  * Removed "application" parameter in tracker_miner_pause(), since
    it now uses g_get_application_name() or TrackerMiner::name
    internally. 
  * Update vtable function process_file() for TrackerMinerFS into a
    signal to be consistent with the rest of the API.
  * Fixed pkg-config file to include dbus-glib.
  * Fixed moving items between two monitored directories. Was unsupported.
  * Fixed g_timer_destroy() warning with timer != NULL.
  
  tracker-store:
  * Updated the Dia documentation for trackerd to detail how
    tracker-store works.
  * Updated SQL generated for FTS queries by SPARQL.
  * Added support for function calls as select expressions in SPARQL.
  * Added support dots at the end of simple OPTIONAL statements in
    SPARQL.

  tracker-miner-fs:
  * Fixed crawling duplicate directories if one is in the config file
    and the other is a removable media.
  * Fixed memory leak with returned removable devices from storage (HAL).
  * Updated the Dia documentation for tracker-indexer to detail how
    tracker-miner-fs works.
  * Fixed so we don't print "miners all finished" more than once.

  tracker-extract:
  * Added tracker_text_normalize() to clean up content used for FTS.
    This function effectively strips non-text characters, extra spaces,
    carriage returns, etc.
  * Added FTS support for MS and ODF document formats.
  * Fixed PDF extractor to use tracker_text_normalize().

  tracker-tag:
  * Added support for removing a tag on a per URN basis instead of
    for all content.
  * Fixed return value

Bugs:

  * Fixes GB#570608 - Translation of firefox-extension
  * Fixes GB#592400 - String translation issues
  * Fixes GB#589059 - Add option to set evolution plugins directory in configure

  Documentation: 
  * Added initial documentation for libtracker-miner.
  * Fixed typo in tracker-processes man page.
  * Fixed warnings when building documenation for libtracker-common
  * Regenerated documentation sections for libtracker-common

  libtracker-common:
  * Fixed memory leak in tracker_string_to_date().
  * Moved TrackerParser API to libtracker-fts, only used there.

  libtracker-db:
  * Updated headers so only one header can be included if used externally

  libtracker-data:
  * Added support for fn:contains and fn:ends-with for SPARQL.
  * Removed unnecessary FTS INSERT and DELETE statements.
  * Updated to avoid unnecessary SQL CAST expressions.

  libtracker-fts:
  * Added to unit tests
  * Removed broken and unused paragraph detection.
  * Moved this from "tracker-fts" everywhere in code base since it is
    a library not an application.

  libtracker-miner:
  * Added get_status() and is_paused() APIs.
  * Removed GetName and GetDescription DBus methods, now in desktop
    files and exposed through TrackerMinerManager API.

  tracker-store:
  * Clean up queued batch updates to the database when clients
    disconnect.
  * Do not use JOIN for simple OPTIONAL patterns in SPARQL
    (significant speed improvement).

  tracker-miner-fs:
  * Added support back for thumbnailing.
  * Added support for full paths in config for IgnoredFiles and
    IgnoredDirectories.
  * Added support for XDG spec. for special user directories. So now
    in the config, IndexRecursiveDirectories and
    IndexSingleDirectories can include "&DOCUMENTS", or "&MUSIC", etc. 
    The list of special locations is listed in the config and
    documented. This falls back to $HOME when not available for some
    distributions.
  * Removed unused files.
  * Updated the default indexed locations to DESKTOP, DOCUMENTS,
    DOWNLOADS, MUSIC, PICTURES and VIDEOS as per the XDG spec (this
    was $HOME).
  * Fixed trying to send thumbnail queues of size 0.
  * Fixed trying to send thumbnails when service is not available.
  * Fixed double unref in thumbnailer code.
  * Fixed 2 memory leaks found while valgrinding.

  tracker-extract:
  * Fixed assertion in HAL is NULL from starting on the command line.
  * Fixed Ctrl+C not working with -d.
    
  tracker-status:
  * Use libtracker-miner APIs instead of DBus calls.
  * Use libtracker-miner API to get display names (translatable).

NEW in 0.7
==========

Improvements / New:

  * Library: libtracker-miner
    A common library for data miners to use allowing easy integration
    with Tracker. This provides D-Bus integration, state and progress
    APIs and a means to pause / resume your miner.

  * Library: libtracker-client
    This API has been completely changed. It is much simpler now and
    relies more on the SPARQL language than specific APIs to query
    Tracker. 

  * Daemon: tracker-store
    Completely reworked to accept SPARQL queries and updates.
    Implements Nepomuk ontology instead of flawed own brand. This
    ontology is implemented following the W3C RDF semantics.

  * Database: Completely redesigned ALL databases.
    These now support triple store and allow much faster querying.

  * Application: tracker-miner-fs
    Implements libtracker-miner and facilitates the old roles of
    tracker-indexer and some of the old roles from trackerd like file
    system crawling. This mines data and sends it to tracker-store to
    put in the database about files AND applications.

  * Application: tracker-sparql
    A command line tool to query or update the databases using SPARQL.

  * Application: tracker-import
    A command line tool to import data kept in Turtle files.

  * Application: tracker-search-bar
    An applet for quickly searching for music, videos, images,
    documents and folders.

  * Application: tracker-status-icon
    Previously tracker-applet, but rewritten and now much simpler.
    This provides state and progress information about all miners
    which are running. This also allows the user to pause / resume
    data miners.

  * Application: tracker-search-tool
    This has been completely rewritten using vala and the new
    architecture underneath it. Support for the old features are not
    quite there yet, but it is similar to its predecessor!

  * Application: tracker-explore
    This is an application written to explore data in the database and
    each item's relationship to the next. This really demonstrates
    Tracker's ontology and provides it through full text searching.

  * Plugin: Evolution
    Now the evolution plugin is supported by the developers instead of
    us dipping into their databases (as previously) which is dangerous
    and unsafe. Also this implements the libtracker-miner API so it
    can be controlled using tracker-status-icon.

  * Patches: Nautilus & GtkFileChooser
    These are currently submitted upstream to support the new APIs for
    continued integration between Tracker and GNOME.

Bugs:

  Too many to list here and so much development some are even obsolete.

Notes:

  There is currently no migration path from 0.6. to 0.7. So all
  configurations will have to be re-set up for now. This is planned to
  be added before a 0.8 release. 

  Man pages have all been revamped providing information about all new
  commands too.

NEW in 0.6.90:
==============

Features:
- Major re-factoring over the last 12 months for cleaner code.
- Modular approach with:
  - libtracker-common 
    (common functions shared across all binaries)
  - libtracker-db     
    (database abstraction and manipulation API)
  - libtracker-data   
    (a higher level data get/set API)
  - libtracker-module
    (an API used by 3rd parties to index their content)
- DBus re-factoring and use of GLib bindings (for maintainability).
  (The method names haven't changed, but the objects have, so the
  client applications will need to be updated).
- Extractors are now run as an external process detached from the
  indexer to not crash the indexer for problematic files.
- The utility applications have all been improved and use GOption
  for argument parsing.
- Configuration is now more centralised and used by applications as
  well as the daemon/indexer.
- File monitoring has been rewritten using GIO and libinotify:
- GnomeVFS support dropped from the project.
- Requirement for GLib 2.16.x.
- Imported libinotify (for use in the daemon for file monitoring).
  (due to lack of MOVE event information from GIO).
- Support for DBus introspection.
- Support for removable media indexing (MMC, USB sticks).
- Support for meta-data caching on removable devices
  (see http://live.gnome.org/MetadataOnRemovableDevices)
- Support for searching with OR operations.
- Support for XESAM (initial support only).
- Added application dedicated to indexing (tracker-indexer).
- Added estimated time remaining while indexing.
- Added module API and framework for applications to add support for
  their media files to be indexed. 
- Added utility applications:
  - tracker-unique   
    (searches for unique values with option RDF filters)
  - tracker-services 
    (lists all ontology services/properties)
  - tracker-info     
    (lists details known to tracker about a particular file)
- Added unit tests for:
  - trackerd
  - tracker-indexer
  - tracker-extract
  - libtracker-common
  - libtracker-db
- Added documentation for:
  - daemon/indexer design
  - libtracker-common
  - libtracker-module

Missing Support:
- Index merging has been removed in this release due to lack of
  time to implementing it and with plans to redesign. SQLite FTS has
  the feature internally and will be used in future releases. This
  is noticeable only for very large data sets where a slowdown can be
  observed.

Tracker 0.6.6
============= (03 Mar 2008)

  Applet
  * HIG fix for preference window.
  * Progress for index merges added.

  Tracker daemon
  * Fixed shutdown of daemon when paused to prevent hangs.
  * Fixed an unfinished final index merge step when next restarted.



Tracker 0.6.5
============= (27 Feb 2008)

  Applet
  * Removed popup window and replaced with tooltip displaying status
    and progress.
  * New Applet preferences to turn off animation/hide icon/set
    smart pause.
  * Smart pause feature which can auto-pause the Tracker daemon
    whenever the user presses a key or moves the mouse, thereby
    improving system responsiveness during indexing.
  * Annoying merge messages have now been removed.
  * Reindex option added.
  * About box added.
  * Now hidden if indexing is disabled.
  * Bugs with constant animation fixed.
  * Animation rate slowed right down so as to be less annoying.

  Tracker daemon
  * Temporary blacklisting of frequently changing files (they are
    indexed after one hour or on next restart of Tracker daemon).
    This prevents constant indexing from downloads and torrents.
  * More blacklisting of common tmp formats and vmware files.
  * Memory leak fixes.
  * Removed CPU-heavy corruption scan which can last long time and
    occurs on battery too at startup when tracker daemon was not
    previously shut down properly. Instead we now use bigger
    transactions with fsync on to prevent corruption in the first
    place (only slightly more disk IO is used during indexing as a
    result).
  * Fixed crashers.
  * Fixed D-Bus shutdown/reindex call.



Tracker 0.6.4
============= (11 Dec 2007)

  * Made indexing more robust by pausing if disk space is low or
    index grows too big.
  * Limit log file size to 10MB.
  * New Tracker Applet - animates when indexing, provides ability to
    pause indexing as well as viewing status and progress feedback
    from indexer, statistics, and notification warnings; it can
    also launch Tracker Preferences and Tracker Search Tool.
  * New power management options enable much better customization.
  * Ignored files fixes.
  * Deskbar/tracker integration fixes.
  * Made most prefs live and affect Tracker in real time; others
    will prompt for restart and/or reindex where necessary.
  * Shell script fixes
  * Fixed Imap bug with embedded Auth in URI.
  * Built-in corruption check and scan when Tracker is not shut down
    cleanly - prevents infinite looping.
  * Fix index deletions.
  * Many more bug fixes and stability improvements.



Tracker 0.6.3
============= (25 Sep 2007)

  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * New index merging which allows for much better performance and
    much less disk hogging I/O.
  * Battery throttling - Tracker now stops indexing when on battery.
  * Many more optimisations - transactions, use of O_NOATIME and
    posix_fadvise everywhere.
  * Check files exist before including in search results.
  * Fixed disabling of indexing option in tracker-preferences.
  * HIG fixes to tracker-preferences screen.
  * Fixed resetting of stats.

  note:
    This version will cause your hard drive to be re-indexed so
    that stats are fixed (previous version broke them).



Tracker 0.6.2
============= (25 Sep 2007)

  * New Sqlite-based indexer which utilises the new incremental blob
    I/O in sqlite 3.4.
  * Highly-optimised email indexing (up to 5x faster).
  * Dramatically reduced disk access and disk contention.
  * Indexer now pauses for a grace period when non-Tracker processes
    write to disk (providing changed files are being watched by
    Tracker) - minimises slowdowns when compiling or checking out
    source code.
  * Makes use of idle class disk IO scheduling if available.
  * Makes preliminary use of NO_ATIME (some disk access still uses
    fopen).
  * Fixed restore of user metadata on re-index (keywords are
    auto-restored).
  * Added increased number of (junk) files to automatically ignore.
  * Improved stopwords.
  * New Deskbar handler that uses the new Deskbar api (2.19+).
  * Fixed old Deskbar handler to remove race condition causing
    crashes.
  * Fixed a number of annoying bugs in email indexing and Tracker
    Preferences.

  note:
    This version will cause your hard drive to be re-indexed due to
    the new Sqlite indexer backend.


Tracker 0.6.1
============= (08 Aug 2007)

  * translations and bugfixes


Tracker 0.6.0 "better late than never"
============= (24 Jul 2007)

  * Evolution Emails (mbox/pop/imap) now indexed.
  * Gaim/Pidgin chat logs now indexed.
  * Applications now indexed.
  * New files indexed - all spreadsheets, csv (these require
    Gnumeric to be installed) and oo draw.
  * Vastly improved and new search UI using a sidebar for categories
    and a new metadata tile.
  * Tagging support in the UI.
  * New tracker-preferences UI for easy setting of prefs.
  * Added libtracker-gtk widget toolkit.
  * Now uses XDG directories.
  * Optimised triple store.
  * Handles multiple triple stores (files, emails and user data are
    all separate dbs).
  * New IDF based ranking algorithm.
  * XMP metadata support added.
  * Made use of async calls in tracker-search-tool to prevent it
    from freezing.
  * Added a 60 second delay before indexing to prevent slowdowns on
    desktop start-up.
  * Added support for crawling directories without watching overhead
    (useful for indexing source code without causing slowdowns when
     compiling).


Tracker 0.5.4 "Speed Daemon"
============= (26 Jan 2007)

  * Indexing at ludicrous speed - massively optimised indexing so
    its now 10x faster than previous version. Indexing speeds are
    now around 100 text files per second (which is about the
    maximum possible considering the I/O time to read 100 files from
    a hard drive).
  * Index while you work - now scheduled even better so it should
    never slow the system down whilst allowing users to work without
    being affected by or even noticing it.
  * Also provides additional --throttle command line parameter to
    customise throttling even further so no need to endure noisy
    fans or hot laptops while indexing.
  * New verbosity param to control how much data is shown on screen
    and in log.
  * Fixed MPlayer backend which is now used if gstreamer backend
    returns no metadata
  * Improved reaping of all spawned apps - no more zombies!
  * Improved mime and text file detection.
  * Added improved deskbar-handler.
  * Got Tracker to run nicely on FUSE based filesystems.


Tracker 0.5.3
============= (24 Dec 2006)

  * Fixed memory leaks when indexing (typical mem usage should now
    be ~6MB RSS when indexing large numbers of files).
  * New improved metadata engine now sports multiple values per
    metadata item and rdf style recursive metadata relationships.
  * Support for Dublin Core types (especially for metadata
    relationships).
  * Changed command line options for trackerd to be similiar to
    other programs.
  * Metadata names now to reflect rdf style syntax (Eg DC:Keywords).
  * Improved indexing of numeric data so that only meaningful
    numbers are indexed (IE must contain 5 or more consecutive
    numbers to be indexable).
  * Improved indexing of filenames so that hyphens and underscores
    are used as word breaks to create a delimited filename in
    addition to the full filename.
  * Improved snippet generator to start/end on a word break if
    possible.


Tracker 0.5.2
============= (21 Nov 2006)

  * Now has l10n/i18n support.
  * Added timeout to all external processes and metadata extractors
    used by Tracker.
  * Added missing OpenOffice templates to our filters.
  * Fixed filters to use different packages like w3m for indexing
    html.
  * Fixed Debian build and added new packages for data files and
    translations.
  * Imporved t-s-t and made snippets wordwrap, made snippets async,
    used Tracker's mime facility, improved highlighting and fixed
    crasher.
  * Limited tracker-extract's memory usage using setrlimit.
  * Added desktop files for tracker-search-tool.


Tracker 0.5.1
============= (07 Nov 2006)

  * Inlined a threadsafe version of sqlite to prevent common errors
    like content not being indexed. This can be overriden for those
    with a threadsafe version of SQlite.
  * New Gstreamer-based audio/video extractor on by default.
  * Made extractors more robust.
  * Fixed a number of compiler warnings.
  * Tidied up the tracker-search-tool to have buttons more evenly-sized
  * Fixed a few leaks and made the D-Bus interface more robust.
  * Imporved IOprio detection.


Tracker 0.5.0
============= (25 Oct 2006)

  * Completely new backend that has been moved from Mysql to the
    nimble Sqlite database and QDBM inverted word index.
  * New tracker-search-tool GUI which allows you to search for your
    files in a google-like fashion with results depicted with
    google-style search snippets.
  * Revamped Rdf Query engine.
  * New lighter design with big dependencies like libextractor
    having been dropped in favour of lighter and optional metadata
    extractors.
  * Added new extractors that can use Totem or MPlayer.
  * New options to tune Tracker for your system. We now have a
    --enable-low-memory setting for use with computers with less
    RAM and a --turbo mode for those  who want indexing to take
    place as fast as possible.
  * New snowball stemmers have been integrated into Tracker to
    provide some of the highest quality open source stemming around.
  * New language-specific stopword lists to prevent indexng of
    common words (which are of little value).
  * Can optionally make use of Pango word breaking for full
    internationalisation support.


Tracker 0.0.4 "Now indexing at Warp speed"
============= (16 May 2006)

  * Hugely optimised indexing when many files are waiting to be
    indexed (especially when you first run trackerd).
  * Mass queueing of files no longer blocks the main thread, meaning
    super fast searches can still be performed during heavy indexing.
  * Eliminated CPU bottlenecks and improved thread synchronisations
    so Tracker now hits the ground running when indexing (approx
    500+ files indexed per minute on inotify-enabled systems).
  * Extended metadata support for more Exif fields.
  * Added more service types.
  * Imporved build and support for FC5 (includes RPMs).
  * Redesigned Database around version 5 of the *embedded*
    in-process MySQL database library.
  * Now uses the auto-repair facility provided by MySQL to
    automatically repair damaged database files so you need never
    worry about losing your precious data.
  * Moved virtually all DB logic into stored procedures which
    provides a clean seperation of DB logic and application logic.
  * Added support for parsing dates in various formats including
    conversion to/from ISO 8601 format
  * Fixed MSWord filter to prevent looping (WvText causes inotify to
    report file write change causing endless looping).
  * Redesigned DB structure to be more generic and service orientated
  * Added support for service types (first class objects) to DB.
  * Cleaned up code warnings and fixed potential crasher.
  * Fixed issues with argv handling.
  * Fixed build issue for Fedora Core 5.


Tracker 0.0.3
============= (29 Mar 2006)

  * Made D-Bus interface more generic
  * Corrected search results of hyphenated search terms.
  * Added support for limiting no. of hits for searches.
  * Added optional support for sorting search results by relevance
    score.
  * A few minor bug fixes (Updating file name metadata correctly
    during move, correcting use of hyphenated search terms).
  * Streamlined the inlined version of libextractor and improved
    build system and fixed bug in previous version which prevented
    compilation of the inlined version.


Tracker 0.0.2
============= (27 Feb 2006)

  * Full inotify support (only compatible with Linux kernels 2.6.13
    or higher) with optimisations for detected moves.
  * Fallback to FAM/GAMIN and manual polling for non-Linux and/or
    non-inotify systems.
  * Improved build system which allows you to specify which file
    monitoring backend to use.
  * Valgrind'ed to remove all leaks.


16 Jan 2006
  *	Added support for Tracker as a Nautilus Search Backend.


05 Jan 2006 
  * Added polling mechanism to watch files in absence of FAM/iNotify
	or when FAM/iNotify watch limits have been exceeded.

13 Dec 2005 
  * Imported Tracker into GNOME CVS.


08 Dec 2005
  * Pre-release of Tracker launched.

15 Sep 2005
