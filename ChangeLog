	Released 0.8.14

	Updated NEWS

	Fixes: GB#622702 - 0.8.13 does not build with gio 2.22 anymore
	Bumped version of GLib required from 2.20 to 2.24

	This is due to commit d0f60bf212624de4aa41a01ab6d5cd7257e5ea50
	Unfortunately, this could not be reverted because other code has been
	applied on top of it. For now, the easiest thing to do is to bump the
	GLib version. Version 2.24 should be quite available now.

	Fixes NB#177447: Remove the 'error' signal from TrackerMiner object
	 * The 'error' signal in TrackerMiner object was setup to return a gpointer
	   via dbus, which glib-dbus didn't like, and thus it was dumping a critical
	   message: g_string_append: assertion `val != NULL' failed

	 * That 'error' signal was actually nowhere used...

	Added -Wno-portability to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
	 * This option is already used in the gnome-autogen.sh, so there shouldn't be
	   any problem in adding it also in our automake initialization. This change
	   will avoid portability warnings when re-compiling the project after some
	   Makefile.am changes (the option from gnome-autogen.sh only applies to the
	   first bootstrap).

	Bug 619868 - don't recheck all monitored directories needlessly
	All string (not dir) lists in the config would call
	tracker_keyfile_object_load_string_list() with NULL return_instead, so
	g_object_set()/g_object_notify() were inconditionally called. Check for
	list equality before notifying the property change.

2010-06-24  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	NFO: After careful measuring we noticed that this index isn't faster
	The index for nfo:belongsToContainer was not faster while testing with
	the Linux source code directory. We did several runs to avoid hot vs.
	cold cache measurement differences. We also tried removing the index
	on nfo:fileLastModified but this didn't result in a significant
	difference (so we're leaving that index for now).

	libtracker-miner: Indentation fixes

2010-06-17  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Fixes NB#174333 - Each file is listed twice in tracker search results
	Unset parent folder so caches are regenerated.

	The issue was due to priv->current_folder being reused for both mtime
	cache (for crawling stage) and iri cache (for indexing stage). So when
	recrawling, the miner changes current_folder without invalidating the
	iri cache, so there could be a mismatch when it enters the indexing
	stage again.

2010-06-17  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fixed broken is_optical detection
	Previously we used content type guessing, this isn't full proof as I
	discovered during testing this branch. Now we use the same method GIO
	uses by looking at the filesystem type/device/mount point (in that
	order).

	Seems to work for all the formats tested here for me:
	- Compaq flash (EOS Canon card)
	- USB stick
	- CD (audio)
	- CD (game)
	- DVD (movie)
	- MMC (SD)
	- USB hard disk

	when a directory is no longer watched.

	* src/miners/fs/tracker-miner-files.c: Make sure directory is no longer
	watched when unmounting (in case we didn't get a pre-unmount signal)

	libtracker-miner: Consider mounts inside recursively indexed locations
	* Also, don't add a location to re-check if already there or if a parent

	Fixes GB#621112: Resources not deleted from store when files removed from removable media
	* As soon as mtime cache is updated with the contents of a given directory,
	check if any element in the mtime cache no longer exists in the FS, and remove
	it from the store if so.

	tracker-miner-fs: only force recheck if mounted path contains one indexed location

	libtracker-miner: properly detect removable media

	Fixes GB#621001: don't allow whitespaces in UUIDs
	* Using MD5 of the mount name for the UUID of optical media
	* Using MD5 of the mount path for the UUID of GMounts without
	a corresponding GVolume

	libtracker-miner: Use GMounts instead of GVolumes
	(as not all GMounts have a corresponding GVolume)

	Fixes NB#172818: Tracker is not indexing new content on EMMC
	* If the mount point detected doesn't setup a GVolume (as it
	is in fstab), then just force a re-check of the directories
	indexed to see if anything changed.

		file created in $cachedir/tracker/ when the FS miner finishes a full
		index (only if the file is not already there). When a re-index is
		forced or database files removed, that file is also removed so that
		the miner detects it and a new first full index is done.

		* Miner-FS is now linked to libtracker-db, so that it can use the new
		API methods to check if the first index was done, and to set the first
		index as done.

2010-05-20  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	TrackerMinerFS: Apply to the iri cache the same fix than d3cf67b05a4.
	This cache has the same flaw, incurring in the same failure if a crawl
	directory has legitimately changed (for example, a new file has been added).

	TrackerMinerFS: Fix mtime cache for crawl directories themselves.
	Mtime cache works by querying the parent folder, but for crawl directories
	there wouldn't be any data for its parent folder, needlessly reindexing
	these again, and leaving orphaned urns in the database. This problem would
	add up in consecutive runs, as direct children nfo:belongsToContainer would
	still point to the orphaned node, thus spreading the problem through the
	hierarchy.

2010-04-29  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: do sanity check on is_parent() and is_descendant().

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: Check more carefully for is_parent().
	Be more intelligent about trailing slashes and don't take exact string matches as a positive.

	Use tracker:uri-is-descendant() in recursive delete operations.

	TrackerMinerFS: Get rid of slash_uri in queries where we use tracker:uri-is-*()
	This is already handled in these functions, so no need for that check in the miner.

	TrackerMinerFS: Improve condition in ensure_iri_cache().

	Remove \n from g_debug and g_criticals.

	TrackerMinerFS: Make mtime/iri caches query per folder through tracker:uri-is-*().
	Also, the query to get all children on directory moving is done through tracker:uri-is-descendant().

	TrackerSparqlExpression: add tracker:uri-is-parent/descendant() sparql functions.

	TrackerDBInterfaceSqlite: Add functions to deal with URIs hierarchy.
	SparqlUriIsParent and SparqlUriIsDescendant have been added, taking 2 URIs and
	returning true if the second is a direct/indirect child of the former.

	TrackerMinerFS: Cache URNs for the processed files.
	This cache is cleared on processing directory change, late additions are also
	handled, as well as cache invalidation on files being moved/deleted.

	TrackerMinerFS: Do not query parent URN frequently if it doesn't exist.
	This is specially visible in the applications miner, since the container
	directories aren't actually stored.

	TrackerMinerFS: Perform one mtime query per folder.
	Now that crawling/processing order is guaranteed to have all items
	in one folder to be handled together, perform a mtime query per folder,
	and compare against these results.

	 * Strings which are split into two ExcelExtendedStringRecord are now properly read.
	 * String contents are now converted from CP1252 or UTF-16 to UTF-8
	 * Reading the string is now done in either 1 or 2 GSF reads, not byte per byte.

	 * Limited the max number of bytes to be read from the stream, to the common safe
	     limit of 3*max_words*max_word_size.
	 * Contents are now normalized and word-counted in a buffered way.
	 * Stop reading the contents when max bytes reached.

	Fixes GB#615178 - Graceful crawling stop
	When crawler was stopped in the middle of a crawling operation, it was actually

	tracker-preferences: Workaround for gtk+ bug setting scalers to max default
	The scaler type in gtk+ seems to be setting the scaler's value to its max
	default when the scaler is in a tab, the tab isn't open and
	gtk_widget_show_all is called for. It also signals when this happens the
	changed signal. In the signal handler we set the config object. If the tab
	is never activated that means that we've written the config value with some-
	thing the user didn't ask for (the default max value). I workaround-fixed
	this by only setting the config object on apply-click.

	libtracker-fts: Separate FTS index from virtual table initialization
	As we do not use the virtual table layer for updates, the combined
	initialization of FTS index and virtual table layer causes problems
	when SQLite decides to disconnect the virtual table. This happens
	on database schema changes.

	With this patch the FTS index can still be used even if the virtual
	table layer is disconnected.

	Disable old tracker-fts test

	SPARQL: Fix crash on deletes when using blank nodes

	Update .gitignore

2010-03-09  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-extract: Improve the documentation and document tracker-utils.[ch]

	Fixed documentation include references

	libtracker-extract: Code clean up
	This involves:

	 - Renaming all tracker_extract_* APIs to tracker_ APIs. We don't do
	   this everywhere and it was completely inconsistent and only for
	   utilities. The structures were not using the same naming either.

	 - Fixed some compiler warnings (for vorbis)

	 - Fixed the includes in libtracker-extract source files. Many were
	   not needed.

	libtracker-extract: Moved exif section docs out of #ifdef

	libtracker-extract: Don't include libtracker-common files in example

	libtracker-extract: Relicense to LGPL from GPL

	libtracker-client: Relicense to LGPL from GPL

	libtracker-client: Added tracker-client.h for central inclusion
	This avoids adding different headers from the same library for 3rd
	parties and is for compatibility with any new changes made. Note that
	the sparql-builder.h is not checked and can be included separately
	still because Vala has no easy way to add #define/#errors.

	libtracker-common: Added check for inclusion outside Tracker again

	tracker-extract: Removed ImageMagick extractor, not used for some time

	tracker-extract: Fixed linking
	Don't link against libtracker-common for extractors which don't use
	libtracker-common APIs directly.

	Also fixed libtracker-extract Makefile because we definitely shouldn't
	be linking with libtracker-common there.

	tracker-extract: Fixed type for force-module option

	tracker-extract: Removed a bunch of unnecessary includes

	tracker-extract: Removed unused defines

	libtracker-extract: Added tracker-extract.h to include other files
	This has been added for compatibility.
	For now, we have removed the TRACKER_ENABLE_INTERNALS check for
	libtracker-common so the extractor modules can be built, but ideally
	those should not need to use libtracker-common.

	tracker-extract: Added --force-module option
	This allows developers to force a particular module is used over all
	the others available.

	libtracker-extract: Added example to examples/libtracker-extract
	Moved mockup from src/tracker-extract/ to here.
	Used MP3 source and added comments to detail what is going on

2010-03-09  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	tracker-store: Fixed the SubjectsAdded signal

2010-03-09  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Updated German translation

2010-03-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Add --add-file docs to tracker-miner-fs manpage.

	tracker-miner-fs: add an --add-file option.
	This command line paramenter will force the insertion of an specific
	file into the store, by spawning a config-less TrackerMinerFiles and
	feeding it the file directly.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Prepare against missing configuration.

	tracker-extract-playlist: Don't relate list entries through nie:isStoredAs
	nie:MediaFileListEntry isn't supposed to be a nie:DataObject, so the use
	of nie:isStoredAs to relate these with the nfo:MediaList is wrong, plus
	it ends up in sparql errors that prevent the addition of playlists to the
	database.

2010-03-08  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Support WITH <uri> syntax for updates
	This has been specified in the current SPARQL 1.1 Update draft. The
	old DELETE FROM / INSERT INTO syntax remains supported to not break
	any clients.

2010-03-03  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Added --eligible cmdline option
	This is used to let people know if the file specified with that option

	1. Indexed
	2. Monitored for changes
	   
	This is based on the rules from the config, etc.

2010-03-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fixes NB#158450: Tracker doesn't remove song from database when ...
	Remove too lax check for not monitoring IndexSingleDirectories children, which
	was also affecting legit dirs in IndexRecursiveDirectories which were a child
	of the former.

	TrackerMinerFS should only emit monitor_directory() for directories where both
	check_directory() and check_directory_contents() have returned TRUE, We're
	actually interested in monitoring any directory (and children) in
	IndexRecursiveDirectories where that does happen, and the latter call shouldn't
	happen for children of IndexSingleDirectories, so it's safe to just return TRUE
	there.

	Fixes NB#155488: After adding a directory under "IgnoredDirectories" key...
	Add comment about memory usage for priv->directories in TrackerMinerFS.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Do not trigger multiple rechecks on config file changes.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Listen to changes in IgnoredDirectories[WithContent].
	Any change on these values will force a check on all indexed
	contents, so all monitors are properly added/removed as necessary.

	TrackerMinerFS: Add tracker_miner_fs_force_recheck().
	This new call forces recheck on any directory previously passed through
	tracker_miner_fs_directory_add(). In addition, monitors are now also
	removed during the (re)crawling phase if told by the implementation.

	TrackerMonitor: Only log removals if the dir was monitored.

	TrackerMinerFS: Check both directory/contents before adding a monitor.
	Without this change, monitors would be added on directories excluded
	by the IgnoredDirectoriesWithContent configuration option.

	TrackerMinerFS: Keep added directories around.
	Now data added through tracker_miner_fs_directory_add() is
	kept around, and the crawler is just handed a const reference
	to it.

	Fix typo in debug message.

	Bug #609004 - Timeout on 1 file during extraction causes 10 to fail .
	TrackerMinerFS can process paralelly as many files as the ::process-pool-limit
	property say, but tracker-extract inspects files one by one. So if some file
	takes longer than the extractor timeout, all the other concurrently processed
	files will receive a DBus no reply/timeout as well.

	So, if we get a DBus timeout on any file that's not the first that was added
	to the processing pool, we retry extraction on that file.

	tracker-extract: Use artist's value in filename when creating new album art

2010-02-18  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Ensure ::check-directory is called on root folders.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Use TrackerMinerFS API to get URNs.
	Now both file and parent URNs are taken from TrackerMinerFS if
	any. In the case a file doesn't exist (i.e. doesn't have an URN
	yet) an anonymous URN will be used as usual.

	TrackerMinerFS: Add API to know a file/parent urn.
	This API allows retrieving the URN for a GFile being
	processed (to check for file existence in the store),
	or it's parent's (to set nfo:belongsToContainer
	relationship).

	Since files are guaranteed to be processed together
	with the other files in the same folder, and parent
	folders are guaranteed to be fully processed before
	its children, The method to cache the parent folder
	URN should have little impact on performance.

	In order to retrieve the URN for the file itself,
	a extra call to item_query_exists() had to be added,
	unfortunately, doing so on should_change_index_for_file()
	is not an option, since it happens on the crawling
	phase, so all URNs would have to be stored. This is
	a performance vs memory usage problem.

	TrackerMinerFS: warn if one file has >1 URNs.

	TrackerCrawler: Report a GNode with the file hierarchy.
	TrackerCrawler now provides a GNode with the directory/file
	hierarchy on ::directory-crawled for each GFile passed at
	tracker_crawler_start(), all the stats are also reported
	per directory root. ::finished is now only used to notify
	about interruption.

	TrackerMinerFS now takes a copy of each of the GNodes intead
	of appending directly to items_created. Whenever items_created
	is empty, the stored GNodes are checked for more contents to
	inspect. This is done so TrackerMinerFS guarantees that a
	directory has been already added to the store before processing
	its children.

	Tracker-extract: Do not specify subject in embedded insert.

	TrackerSparqlBuilder: allow embedder to specify the subject.
	Embedded inserts now only consist of predicate/subject, so the
	embedder is able to specify the subject the data is applying to.

	libtracker-common: Port sparql_builder_object_unvalidated to Vala

	NCO: Add IMAddress and adapt existing IM classes and properties
	This commit applies various changes to the ontology for multiple
	reasons. It increases consistency between email addresses, phone
	numbers, and IM addresses. This enables the use of anonymous contacts
	for IM messages. Furthermore, this commit also simplifies queries
	that involve merged contacts, which improves the performance
	significantly. Despite all the changes, full backward compatibility is
	retained during a transition period as this commit does not yet remove
	the deprecated classes and properties.

	The class nco:IMAddress and the property nco:hasIMAddress have been
	added. nco:hasIMAddress can be used by any nco:Contact and represents
	an instant messaging address consisting of nco:imID and nco:imProtocol.
	This improves consistency with how email addresses and phone numbers
	are handled in NCO.

	nco:IMContact has been deprecated in favor of using nco:PersonContact
	with nco:hasIMAddress. This avoids special casing IM contacts.

	The address of a nco:IMAccount is now stored in nco:imAccountAddress,
	this allows to consolidate the nearly duplicate properties such as
	nco:imId and nco:imContactId and the other nco:im* and nco:imContact*
	property pairs. To improve consistency among these properties and ease
	transition, nco:imContactCapability has been renamed to
	nco:imCapability.

	nco:hasIMAccount has been deprecated as it did not provide any
	information as it was only applicable to a single subject,
	nco:default-contact-me.

	nco:fromIMAccount has been deprecated and replaced by nco:hasIMContact,
	which provides the same information in reversed form, that is, it links
	IM accounts of the user to IM contacts (buddy list).

	nco:MetaContact and nco:metaContact have been deprecated in favor of
	storing merged contacts. Contact details can be linked to the data
	source with named graphs in future versions of Tracker. This provides
	vastly simpler and more efficient access to merged contacts.

	libtracker-miner: Removed tracker_miner_fs_get_directories()
	This is no longer needed.

	tracker-miner-fs: Improved feature to update indexed paths in realtime
	This does several things:

	  - Avoids the TrackerConfig for the object notify if the list data
	    hasn't actually changed.
	  - Allow tracker_keyfile_object_load_string_list() to return the list
	    instead of use it with g_object_set().
	  - Don't load defaults into config everytime we reload, only
	    initially.
	  - Directories are removed from list of dirs when indexed, so we now
	    keep a list of config specified directories to index so we have a
	    real list to compare to when the config updates (previously the
	    old list was NULL if indexing was complete leading to a reindex of
	    ALL locations because the list was different).
	  - Don't notify about the index-{recursive|single}-directories twice.
	    This happened because we loaded the config into the GObject and
	    then did post processing on the &DESKTOP and other special values
	    which re-set the value in TrackerConfig.

	libtracker-common: Added tracker_gslist_with_string_data_equal()

	TrackerMonitor: Workaround design flaw in libinotify.
	libinotify keeps a hashtable of watch descriptor/handle, and does
	removing in an asyncrhonous manner. So when inotify_add_watch()
	reuses a watch descriptor, removing/adding whithout having
	libinotify process the events coming from the fd may cause the
	wrong handle (the just added one) to be removed.

	TrackerMonitor now adds, and then removes old monitors, when a
	directory is moved, so there's no opportunity to remove the wrong
	handle.

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Get all children URIs in a single query when moving a folder.
	nfo:belongsToContainer isn't used since at the moment the data in there
	is not actually reliable.

	Ensure the dest path info is removed before a move operation.
	Also, now nie:isStoredAs is updated properly.

	Ensure nie:isStoredAs is set to the object URN.

	TrackerSearchBar: Fix opening files.

	Adapt tracker-search-bar to not use URI=ID.

	Fix tracker-tag so no URI=ID is assumed.

	Make tracker-search show the item URI if it exists.

2010-02-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	DROP GRAPH now uses the value of nie:url instead of subjects

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make tracker-info work again with URNs besides URIs and paths.

	Fix typo when creating preupdate queries.
	the wrong TrackerSparqlBuilder was being used on some calls.

	Still use URI as graph name.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Allow late addition of tracker:mountPoint.
	Since the URNs are now anonymous, we might not know yet the mount
	point URN, so this data is added when the mount point GFile is
	processed.

	Normalize paths so getting the UDI for the mount dir GFile works.
	Also, a leak in that function was fixed.

2010-02-03  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Fixed a critical warning on Writeback()

	Compilation warning fix

	Fixed the tracker-writeback function to cope with anonymous blank nodes
	Files now have an anonymous blank node as subject, this means that the subject
	no longer is the same as nie:url. This commit fixes this situation.

	Fixed bug with nmm:albumTrackCount being set to different values
	... for the same album, which was failing the insert query for
	the entire song

	Added support for DELETE to TrackerSparqlBuilder class

2010-02-03  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Turn preinserts into more generic preupdate.
	Now implementations must open/close inserts themselves, since more
	than just inserts could be added there.

	Fix commit 07580f1 to use preinserts for affiliation info.

	Make tracker-info not rely on ID==URI.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Use new tracker-extract API to compose insertions.
	The newer tracker-extract DBus API is used and later composed into
	a single query. Also, some miscellaneous places that didn't rely on
	ID!=URI have been changed.

	Modify tracker-extract to return 2 sparql strings.
	The first argument will be preinserts, which are the necessary
	insertions that actual file metadata rely on. The second argument
	is just a collection of data triples so it can be inserted together
	with the rest of the data in the miner.

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to add WHERE clauses.
	where_open(), where_close() and subject_variable() have been added.

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to prepend a raw string.
	This can be used by miners to compose together any prerequisite
	insertion (for example, artist/album in audio files) with the actual
	entity data (the audio file in this case).

	Add API to TrackerSparqlBuilder to allow embedded insertions.
	Embedded insertions may take triples so data taken from tracker-extract
	can be afterwards inserted together with the rest of the data in the
	miner.

	Using the the right key for EXIF data in PNG extractor

	Removed debugging printf

	Fixed a bug in the XMP parser, added EXIF to PNG extractor

2010-02-02  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-control: If using -r and -s together, wait 1s before -s
	Race conditions were observed without the wait and D-Bus errors about
	timeouts were being reported. This avoids that.

	libtracker-miner: Added G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO for estimated remaining time
	This is only done for >= 1% progress changes and never > 1/sec.
	This also means that using verbosity=1 we will only get these updates.

	tracker-status: Cleaned up status output
	Less text and also removed the --show-key option.
	Plus tracker-status didn't have an up to date man page.

	libtracker-miner: Do alias lookups for pause/resume
	This means we can use "Files" instead of org.freedesktop... for miner names.

	libtracker-miner: Don't list Miner.Files.Reindex interface

	tracker-status: Error if miner is supplied without pause/resume

2010-02-01  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerSearchBar: Fix wrong check in pixbuf_get().
	a TrackerCategory was being passed, but the function expected a
	gboolean is_image. pixbuf_get() now uses TrackerCategory, which is
	more versatile.

	tracker-miner-fs: Added reindex by mime code to get files to update

	tracker-miner-fs: Added reindexing by mime type for new extractors
	This is the initial work only. Nothing actually works yet. Currently
	there is a D-Bus API in tracker-miner-fs to call and tracker-control
	has a command line switch (-m) that can be used to call
	tracker-miner-fs and perform the operation which still needs
	implementing.

	Fixes NB#153444, tracker-stats giving incorrect results for contacts after...
	Classes with multiple inheritance caused multiple decrements to the
	class count which meant tracker-stats was inaccurate.

	libtracker-client: Removed debugging

	libtracker-miner: Fixed evolution plugin enable/disable calling exit()
	This occurred because we didn't release the name when we clean up the
	dbus data for the miner. Subsequently, disabling and then enabling the
	plugin would try to re-register the miner's name and find it was in
	use and so exit() would be called in libtracker-miner. Now this
	is fixed and Evolution doesn't completely exit.

	Use a separate thread to dispatch DBus writeback signals.
	TrackerWritebackDispatcher has been splitted into dispatcher/consumer.
	The former runs in a separate thread, listening for writeback signals
	from tracker-store and notifying the main thread about them. The consumer
	just has these petitions queued and processes them one by one,

	This way, operations performed by the consumer may be blocking, while
	the dispatcher will be able to receive DBus signals at any time.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Make sure the fd isn't closed as long as the lock stays.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Handling writeback in tracker-miner-fs
	When a writeback takes place, tracker-miner-fs must NOT create a SPARQL Update
	that contains any predicates that are marked as tracker:notify. For this
	reason I added a mechanism for marking a subject in tracker-miner-fs's queues:
	The first next time the subject is to be analyzed it checks whether the
	subject was marked. If it was marked then instead of doing a full extraction,
	tracker-miner-fs will only get a few properties (like mime, mtime, size).

	* MIME because the content-type of a file might have changed by writeback
	* Size because the size of the file might have changed by writeback
	* Mtime because the writeback will update the file's mtime, and we want
	  to sync tracker-store with that too

	Added writeback module for XMP

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerWritebackDispatcher: add sanity check on returned metadata.

	TrackerWritebackMP3: Make it inherit from TrackerWritebackFile.

	TrackerWritebackFile: Added base implementation for local files.
	This object implements file locking for local files, and provides an
	specialized vmethod as well.

	tracker-file-utils.c: Add file locking API.
	This API will be used by the writeback service, so TrackerMinerFS
	implementations don't obey updates while metadata is being written.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Added filter for the list of rdf:type being passed vs. module to elect

	Pass the known list of rdf:types to the Writeback signal

	Only report writeback for default graph

	Implemented writeback for MP3's Title field using id3lib
	This is a prototype implementation

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-writeback: Hook writeback modules to the dispatcher.
	There's still work left to do, the dispatcher should maintain a mimetype/module
	hashtable, so it can create TrackerWriteback objects for each file, right now
	the first found module (currently the dummy one) is used.

	TrackerWriteback: add dummy module.
	Modules will derive from the TrackerWriteback object, its API has to be devised
	yet.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Changed from using a method to listening on the Writeback signal
	Also added a small sample that calls back in on_sparql_result_received that
	will simply print all the statements that have predicate tracker:writeback set

2009-11-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Add initial tracker-writeback implementation.
	It does close to nothing at the moment, but functionality will be added over
	time.

2009-11-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Signalling Writeback in case a property marked as tracker:writeback is changed

	All miner SPARQL Update queries need FROM or INTO to avoid writeback
	When INTO or FROM are passed, graph in tracker_writeback_check wont be NULL.
	A NULL graph means 'default graph' or 'something that came from the user'.
	We only want to do writeback for things that came from the user. This is how
	we distinguish between content from the miner and content from the user.

	libtracker-miner: Make TrackerMiner use standard gio callbacks and port TrackerMinerFS
	TrackerMiner previously used custom callbacks for its async calls
	tracker_miner_execute_sparql, tracker_miner_execute_update etc. This commit
	changes the API to make them use the standard GLib callback pattern
	my_callback (GObject *source, GAsyncResult *result, gpointer user_data) .
	The API of TrackerMinerFS is not changed, but it's internaly ported to the
	new functions.
	The miners using the tracker_miner_* functions have to be ported to use
	the new API.
	This patch also ports the existing miners.

2009-11-23  Juan A. Suarez Romero  <jasuarez@igalia.com>

	Fixes GB#598470,  Search entry icons grayed out

	Fixes NB#600973, tracker-control: don't use "-h" to remove thumbnails

2009-11-23  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Critical messages are fine for most impl errors.
	Miner implementations weren't able to extract metadata, probably for a good
	reason, so issue critical warnings for all of them, but the "file not found"
	case.

2009-11-23  Juan A. Suarez Romero  <jasuarez@igalia.com>

	tracker-parser: skip empty strings in parser_next

2009-11-23  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	libtracker-miner: Fixed redundant code.
	Spotted by Philip.

	libtracker-miner: Fixed memory corruption for dir moves
	Philip spotted this after Tshepang's testing. There are three issues
	this patch fixes:

	1. Inserting a GFile into a hash table without incrementing a
	reference causes a reference count problem and leads to using memory
	which is no longer valid.

	2. Using the same INotifyHandle* for a different directory name is
	broken and that's what we were doing when moving directories.

	3. We should actually recursively be removing all old monitors and
	re-adding monitors for the new sub-directory names.

	tracker-extract: Fixed link errors using binutils-gold's ld

	libtracker-common: Fixed tests linking errors with binutils-gold's ld

	tracker-extract: Fix autofoo warnings about unused mockup_SOURCES

	libtracker-miner: Fixed example linking with binutils-gold's ld

	libtracker-miner: Moved test/ directory to examples/
	I did this because although it does test the API, it also shows it off
	like tracker-miner-fs. This is mostly a good way to show others how to
	build their own miners.

	libtracker-miner: Updated test case to use ::finished not ::terminated
	Actually, ::terminated is completely unused and should probably be
	removed at some point.

	tracker-miner-fs: Removed unused tracker_storage_new() call
	This was resulting in us listing and iterating all HAL devices twice
	each time miner-fs was started

	tracker-miner-fs: Index $HOME one level deep by default

	tracker-extract-mp3: Extract nmm:albumTrackCount if available

	tracker-miner-fs: Fix SPARQL for files without extracted metadata
	A call to tracker_sparql_builder_insert_close was missing for files

	SPARQL being sent to tracker-store.

	libtracker-common: Check when retrieving SPARQL builder result

	Added support for INTO and FROM to SPARQL UPDATE extension
	This adds support for INTO and FROM to the SPARQL UPDATE extension, it doesn't
	store the uri being passed. It only passes it as parameter from to all

	tracker-extract: MP3 extractor code clean up

	libtracker-common: Fixed regression in tracker_coalesce()
	Don't check !result in the for loop, we still need to free strings

	This looks all kinds of wrong. I tested it and it seems to work fine.

	tracker-extract: Fixed MP3 id3v20/v22 memory corruption
	Was a select case fall through

	libtracker-common: Don't return non-stripped strings in tracker_coalesce()

	  - tracker-albumart-dummy.c   : C code that does nothing but return FALSE,
	                                 elected in case both are absent
	  - tracker-albumart-generic.h : Generic API for above

2009-11-03  John Carr  <john.carr@unrouted.co.uk>

	Add AC_CACHE_CHECK magic around ioprio checking.

	TrackerMiner: Don't try to free invalid pointers.
	the result GPtrArray might not be a valid pointer if error is set, so only
	free it if the sparql query was successful. Also, don't try to free it twice,
	although this was safe due to tracker_dbus_results_ptr_array_free() nullifying
	the pointer after freeing.

2009-10-30  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-extract-mp3: Generate full date/time value for recording year
	Fixes NB#120255.

2009-10-30  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	This can be the case for some miners like the evolution plugin

	tracker-processes: Renamed to tracker-control, now in src/tracker-control

2009-10-28  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: Fix up prototype for ::finished.
	The ::finished signal changed parameters some time ago, but the function
	prototype in the class struct didn't.

	tracker-extract: initialize albumart on standalone mode as well.
	This was reporting critical warnings from non-initialized caches in there.

	Plug a bunch of potential leaks.
	For some cases, word wasn't even used, for others the code would try to
	fill in the same tag several times, leaking the older values.

	tracker-extract-mp3.c: Retrieve nmm:trackNumber.
	Also, track number is dealt everywhere as a integer, so no strings are leaked.

	tracker-extract-mp3: Add missing break; when parsing id3v20 tags.
	This could lead to doubly freed memory, since the same string was assigned
	to genre and copyright.

2009-10-28  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Add ontology log output line for G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO

	tracker-extract: Filter all file based ontology from LSA extractor

	Also cleaned up Makefile.am

2009-10-27  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Do not leak variables (reference cycle)

2009-10-27  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: Use G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO for the SPARQL output
	This allows us to use verbosity=1 to just see the SPARQL output and
	nothing else.

	tracker-extract: Removed some logging on start up
	Based on a patch from 0.6 for NB#126773, trackerd and tracker-extract
	spam syslog. See commit 65adc16dc0183a1a9b08eb85440312399748262a.

	libtracker-common: Fixed logging so G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO is verbosity=1

	libtracker-common: Added tracker_info() to use G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO

2009-10-27  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Support fts:rank and fts:offsets functions in queries

	tracker-extract: clean up libstreamanalyzer integration a bit

2009-10-26  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Use update buffer for deletes as well
	This fixes handling of FTS updates when deleting or updating property
	values by reusing the logic written for inserts.

	libtracker-data: Factor out function string_to_gvalue

	libtracker-data: Factor out function get_old_property_values

	SPARQL: Flush update buffer after DROP GRAPH

	libtracker-data: Add rollback callback
	This prevents sending events for updates that are rolled back.

2009-10-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@gnome.org>

	TrackerMinerFiles: Don't overwrite throttle settings.
	Throttle is already being set based on battery status in constructed(), don't
	overwrite that setting.

	TrackerMinerFiles: Unify battery state handling.
	Having on_battery and on_low_battery separated separatedly actually had logic
	gaps, such as low battery + charging state, and was setting throttling
	regardless of the AC power state.

2009-10-26  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Codestyle and indentation for the StreamAnalyzer support

2009-10-26  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-search-tool: Make single-instance.

2009-10-23  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	maemo: Add maemo:relevance property

2009-10-22  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-extract: store as many words as the FTS config says.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: Do not spam tracker-status-icon.
	Now actual processing is reported in miner progress, not walking through every
	mail folder, which made progress signalling go crazy.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: Send sparql updates without waiting for reply.
	The number of DBus messages send may be huge, and it may take long for them to
	be answered, clobbering the pending calls hashtable. This fixes some random
	OOM observed when sending ~30K messages.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: free error in DBus responses if any.

	TrackerEvolutionPlugin: plug a leak.

2009-10-22  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Extend update buffer
	Support multiple resources in the update buffer at the same time to
	improve performance for certain types of insert statements.

2009-10-22  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@gnome.org>

	Fix typo in tracker-power-devicekit.c.

	Fixes NB#135969.

2009-10-20  Claude Paroz  <claude@2xlibre.net>

	Add omitted files for GB#570608

2009-10-20  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make progress go forward in the Evolution miner.
	Progress calculation was based on items left, so it actually went backwards
	for tracker-status-icon.

	Make the evo plugin use the same DBus name everywhere.
	This was preventing TrackerMinerManager to keep track of it.

2009-10-19  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Update mtime checking with latest tracker-store requirements.
	mtimes are now stored with timezone info in tracker-store, TrackerMinerFS should
	use the same format when checking a file has been modified.

	TrackerConfigFile: Also make create events trigger reparsing.
	Create events from the file monitor was being sort of ignored, with this
	TrackerConfigFile reparses configuration correctly with the technique used
	by tracker-preferences to rewrite the config.

2009-10-17  Christian Kirbach  <Christian.Kirbach@googlemail.com>

	Updated German translation

	tracker-preferences: Fixed make distcheck error

2009-10-16  John Millikin  <jmillikin@gmail.com>

	Fixes GB#590501, Album art heuristic always fails
	I added to this patch by making the code cleaner and by not iterating the
	GDir* more than once. I also added some additional debugging to make it
	clear what path is taken for each file.

2009-10-16  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-status-icon: Add global keybinding for searching.
	This is currently hardcoded to <Ctrl><Alt>S.

2009-10-16  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Do not require AS when using select functions

	SPARQL: Support multi-valued properties as functions
	Use GROUP_CONCAT(?,',') to combine multiple values.

	SPARQL: Support single-valued properties as functions
	Fixes NB#134107.

2009-10-16  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Remove sqlite3 command line dependency
	It was used in some old tests that don't exist anymore

2009-10-15  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Right command in the tests script

2009-10-15  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-status-icon: Set default progress/fraction as 100%
	We do this because if the status icon is restarted for some reason, it
	then is usually correct until the next progress update.

	tracker-status-icon: Make progress menu more visually attractive

2009-10-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-preferences: Allow configuring status icon visibility.

	TrackerStatusIcon: Add config to tweak status icon visibility.
	A new config file has been added for tracker-status-icon. At the moment
	the only setting is for visibility, possible values are never/always/when
	active.

2009-10-15  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Flag to enable functional tests. Default=no
	Functional tests are python programs to run once tracker is installed.
	This flag include/exclude the functional tests from the dist target.

2009-10-15  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-search-tool: Cleaned up UI so things look a bit better

2009-10-15  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	XML describing the functional tests available

	Functional test to run once tracker is installed
	Simple test case to try tests in integration.

2009-10-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	tracker-store: Remove all traces of TrackerStorage.
	This is handled by tracker-miner-fs itself, TrackerStorage callbacks were
	mere stubs, this is now removed.

	TrackerMinerFS: Do not loop infinitely when unmounting while processing.

2009-10-14  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Fix timezone handling when inserting time_t

	libtracker-data: Fix transaction handling
	Make sure to rollback all changes when an error happens during a
	SPARQL update.

	libtracker-db: Make sure SQLite statement is reset when using cursors
	Statement reset is only implicit if all results are read. A missing
	reset can lock the database, so we need to make sure to always reset
	unused statements.

2009-10-14  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Fixes #141698, List of saved playlist has names of albums too
	New nmm:Playlist class

	Album is subclass of MediaList, so using MediaList for a music playlist would
	show albums and playlists in the query results.

2009-10-14  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	Require sqlite >= 3.6.16
	Not all of our test cases pass with earlier versions.

	Fixed README - inconsistencies with numbering/contents

2009-10-09  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix tracker_language_stem_word().
	the case with stemming disabled was completely broken, not taking into account
	word_length, and returning a dup'ed string as const gchar*. Made it more
	consistent by always returning a duplicated string, and taking into account
	word_length in non-stemmer case. The only caller has been updated as well.

	Improve docs for libtracker-common.

	TrackerConfigFile: Turned into an abstract object.

	Fixes GB#595752 - Minor string fixes

2009-10-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't index duplicate MMC and config paths
	Previously, if a removable device was mounted on $HOME/foo and
	$HOME/foo was in tracker-miner-fs.cfg, it would be iterated twice. Now
	we check for this and drop the .cfg version in favour of the removable
	device mount point.

	libtracker-common: Now normalise paths returned in tracker-storage

	libtracker-common: Fixed inconsistent GSList returns and mem leak
	The API was inconsistent here. Some API calls returned a GSList with
	pointers and some returned a GSList with newly allocated pointers. Now
	everything is newly allocated.

	The return value in tracker-miner-files.c is now freed when getting
	removable devices too.

	Fixed documentation warnings for missing libtracker-common symbols

	libtracker-common: Use GSList for tracker-storage* API

	libtracker-common: Removed unnecessary casts and reverse lists prepended

2009-10-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Make the PDF extractor use tracker_text_normalize().

	Add FTS support for MS and ODF document formats.

	Add tracker_text_normalize()
	This function is meant for FTS in extractors, receives UTF8 text and tries to
	strip non-text characters, extra spaces, carriage returns and such, providing
	a suitable string for nie:plainTextContent.

2009-10-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	MTP: Let mtp:ScanType subclass nie:InformationElement
	Allows nie:description on instances.

2009-10-08  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix up API docs for libtracker-miner.
	GObject docs weren't being generated due to object and class structs not being
	added to libtracker-miner-sections.txt, also tracker_miner_fs_notify_file() has
	been added there.

	TrackerMinerFS: turn process_file() into a signal.
	This has been done to fit better with the rest of the API, also
	tracker_miner_fs_notify_file() has been added to replace the callback
	parameter, since implementations can do metadata extraction asynchronously,
	they'll be responsible of calling this function. Applications and files miners
	have been modified.

	TrackerMinerFS: make it possible to process files parallelly.
	Now there is a pool of files being processed, controlled by the
	TrackerMinerFS::process-pool-limit (default value of 1), which
	specifies the maximum number of files that can be processed at
	the same time. Code flow has changed so no new files are processed
	until there is room in the pool.

	TrackerMiner: Remove application parameter from tracker_miner_pause().
	This is not necessary for internal use, just for the DBus API, it now
	uses internally either g_get_application_name() or TrackerMiner::name.

2009-10-08  Matej Urbančič  <mateju@svn.gnome.org>

2009-10-07  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-tag: Fixed so you can now remove tags by file
	Before you could only remove the whole tag for all files that were
	linked to it. Now you can use:

	fix a couple of warnings in tracker-utils
	tracker-sparql always returned false regardless of success.

	use AM_SILENT_RULES if present

	respect HOME over the value in /etc/passwd
	g_get_homedir does not respect the value of HOME.  Explicitly check the value of
	HOME, and if it is set, it takes precedence over the value in /etc/passwd.  If
	it is unset, we fall back to the value in /etc/passwd.

2009-10-06  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	fix timezone tests
	g_date_set_time_t uses the environment variable TZ to convert the time between
	timezones.  If the timezone is not UTC, the tests would fail previously.  We now
	save and restore the TZ value, and set the value to UTC while running the test.

2009-10-05  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

2009-09-29  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: Use XDG spec for special user dirs in config
	This means now the user can specify "&USER_DIRECTORY_DOCUMENTS" and it
	will point to whatever the XDG config says in
	/etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults and use those dynamically.

	For now saving the config back is not supported so well. This can be
	improved in the future and it is currently unused in tracker-miner-fs
	anyway. The preferences need some love after this too.

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't try to send thumbs if service is disabled

	tracker-miner-fs: Don't send 0 thumbnail sized queues
	Also print we are sending the items BEFORE we send them to make

	TrackerMinerManager: Fix typo.
	The hashtable key must be the dbus name for the miner, it was being copied
	somewhat random memory.

	libtracker-client: Make it able to cancel individual calls.
	All async functions return a guint which can be used in tracker_cancel_call()
	so the call is cancelled, tracker_cancel_last_call() now also uses this
	infrastructure, although this function should be deprecated/removed at some
	point.

2009-09-25  Michael Biebl  <biebl@debian.org>

	Sort file list in POTFILES.{in,skip} alphabetically

	Update list of translatable / non-translatable files
	Update POTFILES.{in,skip} after the merge of the evolution branch to
	fix "make check"

	Remove duplicate EXTRA_DIST / CLEANFILES
	EXTRA_DIST and CLEANFILES were specified twice, the second overriding
	the first. As a result $(desktop_in_files) was not added to the dist
	tarball.

	Remove DIST_SUBDIRS
	automake will handle DIST_SUBDIRS correctly automatically for SUBDIRS
	which are added conditionally. Specifying them manually actually breaks
	"make distclean" and subsequently "make distcheck". So simply remove it.

2009-09-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerResultsWindow: Cache the pixbufs in the model.
	Getting the icons can be quite expensive, these are now cached in the model.

	TrackerResultsWindow: Open selected items on row-activated.

	TrackerResultsWindow: grab pointer/keyboard on popup.
	This makes the results window behave as expected wrt keyboard handling for the
	treeview and pressing esc or clicking outside the window to pop it out.

	Turn TrackerResultsWindow into a GtkWidget.
	It inherits from TrackerAlignedWindow, and does some things in a more proper
	way.

2009-09-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	tracker-status: Fixed typo in --help

	tracker-search: Now can use FTS with category searching
	Now when using options like --images the search terms can be
	used. Previously this only worked with no command line switch.

	Now added some more categories too, such as:

	 --folders
	 --videos
	 --documents

	Renamed:

	 --image-files to --images
	 --music-files to --music

2009-09-23  Michael Biebl  <biebl@debian.org>

	Add missing files to POTFILES.in
	According to 4ddf3304d4c3909ab9ec9cf56edcb495e1d634c3 the miner desktop

2009-09-23  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerStatusIcon: use tracker_miner_manager_get_display_name().

	TrackerMinerManager: Rely on desktop files to get to know miners data.
	Also, tracker_miner_manager_get_display_name() has been added, it can
	be used to get a translated display name for the miner, instead of
	stripping things from the DBus name.

	Add .desktop files for miners.
	These are installed in $(datadir)/tracker/miners, and will be used to
	get to know available miners, translatable display name/comment,
	DBus name/path, and other relevant data.

	tracker-explorer: Fix build with vala master

2009-09-14  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Fixes: NB#138860, tracker-miner-fs stops crawling if a directory...
	This was caused by returning TRUE to silently handle missing
	directories, the problem is, we then depend on a "finished" signal
	from the crawler which we never get. As such, we now return FALSE in
	the _start() function if we don't expect to progress any further.

	Also, we now don't reset the GCancellable and don't set the crawler
	into state "running" until the initial checks are done first.

	libtracker-miner: Fixed double free

	TrackerMinerFiles: Hook check-directory-contents to configuration.

	TrackerMinerFS: Forward the check-directory-contents signals.
	This way miner implementations may choose whether to index a folder or not
	based on its contents.

	TrackerCrawler: Add check-directory-contents signal.
	This signal contains both the folder and its children (in a GList), the return
	value will tell TrackerCrawler whether to keep iterating through that folder
	or discard it.

2009-09-10  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: Do not iterate through folders parallelly.
	Previously to this change, the process_func() idle function would be always
	running, starting iteration through folders as soon as the could be processed,
	regardless of having other folders already being iterated. This could lead
	to an scenario where all file descriptors were used under some conditions.

	Now, all processing is fully sequential, so process_func() waits until a
	folder is iterated before going on to the next item.

	libtracker-miner: Don't disable monitoring during crawling
	This meant that no monitors were getting added even though the log

	TrackerMinerFS: Lower the severity of a warning.
	Having a hanging cancellable is not warning worthy. Also, make sure it's NULL
	if process_file() returns FALSE.

	TrackerMinerApplications: Avoid unnecessary warnings.
	Now process_file() returns FALSE if the passed file is not a parseable

	Fixed a crash in init of removable devices
	The initialize_removable_devices function gets a list of paths which it passed
	to tracker_miner_fs_add_directory, which in turn wants a GFile instance. The
	fix converts the path to a GFile before calling the latter function.

	tracker-sparql: Added command line options to make using SPARQL easier
	Added:
	--list-classes
	--list-class-prefixes
	--list-properties

	This allows people to quickly find out what classes we support, the
	prefix they can use for them (to make life easier) and the properties
	associated with a class. The class prefix can be used to get
	properties too.

	tracker-sparql: Removed mingw include

	tracker-sparql: Renamed --path option to --file
	This in so we can add a --properties (-p) option later and because we
	are not pointing to a directory but a filename.

	monitors hash table after a move operation, so monitoring a newly created
	folder with the same name would fail silently.

	Bug NB#136770 - Not able to see the pictures captured with camera application after renaming the current folder.
	Turns out the monitor wasn't replacing the GFile (used as the key) in the

2009-09-02  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Added initial version of tracker-status-icon.
	There are some things missing, the context menu has been ripped from
	tracker-applet, but doesn mostly nothing. It's also missing code to pause
	miners and to switch to idle mode after they're all done.

	TrackerCrawler: Don't starve file crawling if there are higher prio sources.
	A higher priority source running that often is worrying enough to deserve
	a close look, this is a quick fix so the crawler doesn't get stuck.

	Bumped up sqlite version to > 3.6.11
	The sqlite_backup API was introduced in minor version .11 of the

	libtracker-data: Fix assertion failure on FTS updates

	libtracker-data: Use int GValues for booleans
	The tracker_db_*_get_value functions return int GValues for booleans
	as that is how they are stored in the database. To allow comparing
	GValue instances, we also need to use int GValues for values that
	are not yet in the database.

2009-09-01  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

2009-08-31  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Use tracker_miner_commit() explicitly.
	For initial crawling, it will wait until it's completely done. After that,
	any sparql additions will trigger a commit.

	TrackerMiner: Add tracker_miner_commit().
	This function also takes pausing into account.

2009-08-31  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

2009-08-27  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Merge branch 'cursor'

	Removed unused API

	Removed an unused private variable from the cursor type

	Wrap condition in parenthesis.

	TrackerMinerFS: Use the accumulator for the boolean signals.

	TrackerMinerFS: Remove unused vars.

	TrackerMinerFS: No need to disconnect signals, we own these objects.
	TrackerMinerFS owns both the crawler and the monitor, so these won't survive
	finalization, so there's no need to disconnect signals before unref'ing.

2009-08-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Make sure we call the parent class constructed first

	Fix TrackerCrawler call now we use GFile instead of path

	Add dir ignore patterns and moved silly crawl dir checks to start

2009-08-26  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFS: Improve checks on whether a file/dir should be indexed.
	For events coming from the monitor, we just call check-file/directory, since
	the mtime has changed for sure. For crawling, tell the crawler to inspect all
	directories, but mark these which mtime hasn't changed so they can be ignored
	before being added to the processing queue.

	libtracker-common: Improve formatting in SPARQL builder

	tracker-miner-fs: Fix SPARQL for folders

	libtracker-data: Fix crash on FTS update

	TrackerConfigFile: get rid of "lt-" prefixes in app names.

2009-08-26  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Rework the way we mine the file system data
	Now we queue all files first then process them. This allows us to get
	some idea of how many we have for status and progress reports.

	The tracker-crawler now changed signals from process-file and
	process-directory to check-file and check-directory.

	Moved binary name from tracker-miner-fs-new to tracker-miner-fs

	Fixed all Miner->FS namespace changes

	Renamed tracker-miner-process to tracker-miner-fs

	Make sure we ALWAYS force checks on directories and NEVER ignore them

	Also moved functions around so class functions are organised at the top

	Fixed config API for ignored patterns s/ignore/ignored/

	not just recursive paths.

	Added missing TrackerConfig APIs for new config options

2009-08-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Avoid double unref.

	    Experiment for journal synchronization mode

2009-08-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Rename Miner.FS to Miner.Files so tracker-status finds it

	Add miners list and start them one after each other not same time

	Don't use been_started AND process_dir_id and emit finished signal

	Make sure we call constructed for the parent class first.
	This is why the FS miner wasn't appearing on dbus

	Added additional checks from original code for checking file/dirs

	Use defined attributes for g_file_query_info() instead of strings

	Use G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_IS_HIDDEN instead of string

2009-08-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerCrawler: invert meaning of process-file/dir return value once again.
	Now a custom accumulator is used with inverted logic to
	g_signal_accumulator_true_handled, TRUE means keeps processing, and FALSE
	ignore.

2009-08-25  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Fix blank nodes in updates

2009-08-25  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

2009-08-25  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	libtracker-data: Check type only when updating existing resources

2009-08-25  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFiles: Ignore hidden files and directories.

	TrackerCrawler: Use an accumulator for process-[directory|file].
	The meaning of the boolean return value in these signals is now inverted.
	Returning TRUE will also stop further processing, so the default
	implementations for these signals won't be able to clobber the result of
	any added handlers.

	Link to tracker-fts instead of loading it at runtime

2009-08-21  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	TrackerMinerFiles: Handle removable devices.

	TrackerMinerProcess: Refactor directories handling.
	There's no separation between regular directories and removable devices
	anymore. The processing is now taken care by an async idle so no recursion
	problems are possible.

2009-08-21  Martyn Russell  <martyn@lanedo.com>

	Added tracker-status command line options to list running/available miners

	Add tracker-miner-discover to find DBus miner services
	This also makes use of tracker-crawler to find .service files in the
	DBus services directory, the debugging from tracker-crawler was
	unavoidable so the g_debug and g_message statements have been moved to
	tracker-miner-process instead so it can decide if it wants to print
	found/ignored things.

	Also the tracker-crawler finished signal now includes WAS_INTERRUPTED
	boolean so we know if it was stopped prematurely.

	Add missing GetDescription method to DBus xml file

	Added the volume for the root-fs

2009-07-29  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	tracker-miner-fs: fixed thumbnailer warnings

	Moved thumbnailer.[ch] and volume-cleanup.[ch] to tracker-miner-fs
	Also while doing this, some make distcheck issues were fixed.

	We no longer require tracker-marshal-main.c to include
	tracker-marshal.[ch], this is done automatically now.

	tests/tracker-store/ was created and the tracker-events-test.c was
	moved here from tests/tracker-miner-fs. This is still broken for some
	reason so disabled for now.

2009-07-29  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Fix parameters order in g_debug() call.

	Do volumes initialization in a more efficient manner.
	Now tracker-miner-fs gets a list of mounted volumes, according to both HAL and

	tracker-extract: don't try to insert NULL genres in gstreamer module

	tracker-miner-fs: move albumart extraction to tracker-extract
	Now we do the processing in tracker-extract and only request the
	thumbnail for the albumart to be queued from tracker-miner-fs. This
	saves us sending potentially large album art over dbus

	Don't print invalid UTF-8 warnings in tracker-statement-list
	This is of no use. Some things WILL be invalid anyway and printing
	them doesn't help, all it does is raise concerns.

	Disabled setrlimit for now, it is causing problems with gstreamer

	Enable unit tests by default so they are included in make distcheck

	libtracker-common: fixed weird indentation in keyfile-object

	Add \n after interrupt signals

	tracker-miner-fs: albumart messaging clean up

	tracker-miner-fs: moved in tracker-albumart code from libtracker-common
	All the code in libtracker-common/tracker-albumart.[ch] which was used
	from multiple places is only used in miner-fs now so I moved the
	functions into the tracker-miner-fs/tracker-albumart.[ch] and removed
	the libtracker-common module.

	tracker-extract: push all albumart code to tracker-miner-fs
	Now we signal data that is used to be processed for albumart. This is
	all handled in the miner-fs now, so the extractors simply say, here is
	my data and length of data (and some other details like artist), now
	process it. The miner-fs then uses the code previously
	tracker-extract-albumart.c to either download the art, use GdkPixbuf
	or save the data directly to the right filename. The thumbnails are
	then requested staight after.

	tracker-extract: renamed tracker-extract-albumart to tracker-albumart
	This was not an extractor in the first place, just a helper module

	tracker-extract: Sanitise the albumart code with an init/shutdown function
	Also added an initial dbus signal for tracker-extract to be able to
	tell the tracker-miner-fs about new files that need thumbnailing.

	Renamed config modules to reflect real roles
	tracker-config-manager is now tracker-config-file
	tracker-config-utils is now tracker-keyfile-object

2009-07-23  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	SPARQL: Use SQL UNION ALL instead of just UNION
	UNION without ALL implies DISTINCT, which can lead to bad performance.

2009-07-23  Benjamin Otte  <otte@gnome.org>

	Improve performance for SparqlBuilder.object_string
	Don't check characters one-by-one but instead use strcspn to find the
	next character to escape. This improves performance for this function
	significantly.

2009-07-20  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixed make distcheck failures

	tracker-fts: added config module
	Removed the FTS config options from tracker-store too

	Moved config functions and modules around
	Now we have tracker-config-manager which is used to do all file based
	operations for the config file. We also have tracker-config-utils
	which does all the GKeyFile<-->GObject work for us. 

	Perhaps these should be renamed at some point to:

	  tracker-config-file
	  tracker-object-keyfile

	To be more aligned to what they actually do.

	This change involves creating a tracker-config in the miner-fs based

	config.

	The global config will have options which don't belong to any specific
	binary OR apply to all binaries (like verbosity).

	Fix iterating OVER every other device in the processor's list

	Fixed trackerd crasher when shutting down if started in readonly mode

	Check space before creating DBs && disable indexer API when paused
	The debugging is also a bit clearer when we are below the disk space
	threshold as set in the config. The frequency of these messages is
	slightly longer too so we don't fill the logs up so quickly.

	Ported to master by Philip

	Monitor cache time now 1s & processor queue time now 0s for < 50 items
	Now we only wait 1 second before sending files to the processor from
	the monitor module. The reason for this, is to be more responsive from
	monitor events. Now a DELETE event is handled within 1 to 2 seconds if
	the indexer is idle.

	The processor queue handler is set up using a 2 second timeout per
	1000 files. Now when we have finished the initial check of all files,
	we use g_idle_add() instead to make sure the indexer deals with items
	much quicker.

	Rework the processors device and module logic so it is clearer
	This also cleans up some of the debugging so there is less of it. It
	is also now less likely we end up in recursive loops because of real
	time updates from removable devices being inserted and removed (the
	logic here is much simpler and comprehensible

	Added proper DBus debugging to the push modules

	Improved the end_batch time for the push modules.

	Arbitrary lowering priority of SetMany() items

2009-06-14  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Don't do all the g_idle_add nonsense in the push modules
	These were causing a GSource source for each 2000 items being pushed using the
	DBus SetMany() call. Making it actually worse than better. I just removed them
	for now, we might have to replace it with an internal, but static global for
	the module, queue (not a queue per SetMany, like what is being removed here).

	Fixed push modules, bugfix closing the query

2009-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Implemented playlist extractor for fresh Nepomuk-based ontology

	Fixed state machine so we return to previous state after PAUSED
	This bug was simulated by setting the LowDiskSpaceLimit in the config
	to 99 and then starting the daemon. Then setting it to 1 in real time
	should start sending files to the indexer, but instead it was returned
	to PENDING state which meant the queue handler returned and didn't do
	anything since it was expecting IDLE. IDLE was attempted but denied
	given pause conditions.

	Bug NB#118578 - Getting metadata with mafw_playlist_get_items_md fails.
	Make volumes initialization completely sync without running the main loop,
	so it doesn't process petitions before the DBus interfaces are properly
	set up.

	Fixes NB#100123, nie:contentCreated is empty for some of the images

	Fix not crawling inserted removable media
	Now we start the processor again when we get new removable media
	inserted, this bug mainly affects the condition when we have finished
	processing all files and the removable media state changes again.

	The statistics we report about files crawled and time taken is now
	reset and correct each time this occurs.

	The mount point added and removed callbacks from HAL were removed in
	TrackerProcessor and now two functions are called FROM tracker-main.c
	which do the same thing. The reason for this, is that we change state
	while setting volume states and we can't process removable media in
	some states. So to control this we do everything AFTER we have set the
	removable media states correctly.

2009-06-12  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes: NB#119230, tracker-extract: memory management shall be improved
	This is another stab at using setrlimit(). For now we set the memory
	limit to 80Mb as default and 512Mb for AMD. For some reason, anything
	less than ~450Mb doesn't even allow tracker-extract to dlopen the
	modules when we use GStreamer.

	Doing a quick test with tracker-stats before and after shows it is
	working on my AMD64 desktop and still indexing the same amount of
	content.

	libtracker-common: Add TrackerSparqlBuilder

2009-05-29  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	The solution to the 2.5s per 10k items: simply lower the priority of the queue
	This is my analysis about this: It was actually clear when Jürg told me did
	his tests without letting the store-queue's idle handler run. My first idea was
	to also disable it for my tests, and then suddenly 10k inserts finished within
	0.135s instead of 2.5s (latter was a quite dissapointing result, former is the
	expected result).

	My analysis is the following: the queue's GSource had an equal priority as the
	unix socket's GSource of the GIOChannel.

	Meaning that if we lower the priority of the queue's GSource, lower than the
	GSource of the unix socket's GIOChannel, that the latter will run at speed.

	With this mini-patch test tests/estress/socket_stress_test.c will finish in
	about 0.135s on an average desktop. The queue will of course have a lot of
	work afterwards, but any subsequent request on the unix-socket (and probably
	also on DBus, as also DBus's GSource now runs at a higher priority that the
	queue's) will get priority.

	This allows us to queue 10000 INSERT queries in 0.135s instead of 2.5s and yet
	we don't need to halt or disable the queue itself.

	I made this rather large analysis because this apparently is what makes the
	difference in IPC responsiveness for tracker-store's queue design.

	    Jürg had the luminous idea to ask me to change the queue API a bit

	    The changes include:
	     - Rename TrackerStoreQueue to TrackerStore
	     - Rename batch to queue
	     - Don't put single update and single queries on the queue
	     - Handle transaction-max in tracker-store.c, don't make the callers have
	       to care about it

	    This last one implied that I could remove most of the ++priv->batch_count
	    callbacks from tracker-resource.c and that I had to fixup the push modules
	    a bit too.

	    Sorting of the queue

	    The updates, statement_insert, statement_delete and queries follow
	    natural order in priority group. The batch_update, batch_statement_insert
	    and batch_commit follow natural order in non-prioritized group.

	    Sample order:

	    query
	    delete_statement
	    query
	    update
	    insert_statement
	    batch_update
	    batch_update

	Date:   Thu May 21 10:40:37 2009 +0200

	    Introduced TrackerStoreQueue, a queue for querying and updating

	    TrackerStoreQueue is or will be the internal API for most data access and
	    storage. This current implementation uses the GMainLoop and a  GQueue with no
	    priority sorting whatsoever. At a later point in time we want to implement
	    queue_sorter in a more meaningful way. For example meaning that batch_commits
	    have precedence on all others, that queries get precedence after the batch
	    commits, etcetera.

	    Due to its use of the GMainLoop the API is going to block the mainloop, but it
	    wont block the caller's code. It will instead find a nice slot during the
	    GMainLoop the execute itself on. When finished it'll execute first your
	    callback and then your GDestroyNotify. All parameters that you receive in the
	    callback that aren't user_data must not be freed (they are to be considered
	    read-only in your callback).

	signal to update in real time.

2009-05-04  Jürg Billeter  <j@bitron.ch>

	tracker-indexer: Do not directly modify db in applications module

	tracker-indexer: Simplify backup restore code

	tracker-indexer: Use SPARQL for data sources

	tracker-indexer: Use SPARQL for moved files

	libtracker-data: Support internal tracker:uri property

	tracker-indexer: Use SPARQL to delete resources

	tracker-indexer: Use DROP GRAPH instead of direct libtracker-data access

	SPARQL: Initial support for DROP GRAPH queries
	There is currently no real named graph support. DROP GRAPH is handled
	by deleting the resource description (embedded metadata) but retaining
	user annotations.

	rasqal: Support DROP GRAPH queries

	tracker-indexer: Simplify handling of plain text content

	tracker-indexer: Experimental move to SPARQL

2009-05-04  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixed potential leak found in 0.6 branch last week

	Fixes: GB#572237, Remove deprecated Glib symbols
	This reworks the find_orig_uri() which was broken. This now uses
	g_utf8_casefold() instead of g_utf8_up(). The function now oly uses
	g_utf8_casefold() as a last resort after checking the extensions and
	file "name" parts found in the directory do not match. This should be
	more efficient since string creation only occurs as a last step. Also
	the info and orig_info were not being compared in the first place
	which is another bug fixed here.

	* src/trackerd/tracker-status.[ch] (tracker_status_is_initialized): New
	  function.

	Added unit tests to the albumart path generation algorythm. Still some
	cases pending to test.

2009-04-24  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Comment out extractor tests that require testdata.
	The test cases for extraction that require generation of test data are
	commented out so they won't fail in automated checking.

2009-04-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Added more information about module use to tracker-extract
	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-extract.c: Added debugging so we know
	  which modules are loaded on start up and to know which modules are
	  used to extract content on a per file basis to help when we have
	  multiple extractors handling the same mime types.

	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-main.c: Change logging format when
	  running stand alone and not writing to a log file and don't log
	  everything, only log based on the verbosity setting.

2009-04-24  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Add mock test
	A completely empty unit test file was breaking gtester report tool.

	Fix gtester report
	tracker-dbus-test's output was non-utf8 text, and that was
	breaking the gtester XML parsing. Now tracker-dbus-test catch and verify
	the output, without printing it.

2009-04-24  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Performance improvements to jpeg extraction
	We now do much less unnecessary formatting using libexif for better
	performance.

	Read mp3 files in parts in extraction
	We now read last 128 bytes for id3v1 metadata separately from mmap of the mp3
	file in mp3 extraction for better performance. We now handle large mp3 files
	without problems.

	Fixes NB#111560

2009-04-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Fixes #578159 – Tracker starts to index when removable media is inserted, regardless of user preferences.
	* src/trackerd/tracker-processor.c (tracker_processor_stop): Set state to IDLE
	  right before sending files over to the indexer, so it isn't left in PENDING
	  state if there isn't actually any files in the queues.

2009-04-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Changed stats cache timeout to 5m and signal stat diffs then too

	Fixes: NB#109891, If deleting last music track or last video...
	The cache expires now after 3 minutes instead of 1 minute which was
	too short. We now use GetServices every time to fix the case where 0
	items for a service type doesn't show up in the
	SERVICE_STATISTICS_UPDATED signal.

2009-04-24  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Adding missing changes to the makefile for the mockup

	Added an extractor mockup for testing purposes

2009-04-24  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Do not make tracker-indexer commit suicide if tracker-extract doesn't get along.
	If tracker-extract fails to return the PID. extractor_pid is 0, so if
	tracker-indexer tries to kill it afterwards, it ends up killing itself.

	Set GError to NULL before passing it to functions.

2009-04-20  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Transient properties
	Added support for transient properties. Right now the support for these
	properties still stores physically. This is done that way because if we'd use
	TEMPORARY tables in sqlite, the table wouldn't be shared between the processes
	of trackerd and tracker-indexer. When we refactor to letting trackerd do both
	writes and reads, we can instead start using TEMPORARY tables. I have added
	the code for this, but commented out in this commit.
