	Bumped version to 0.6.95 for release

	Fixed make distcheck failures in preparation for 0.6.95

2009-05-21  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Bug 112133 - trackerd-11-1386.rcore.lzo crashed
	Normalize mount point paths in TrackerProcessor, so they're removed properly,
	and the processor doesn't think there are still pending removable media to
	inspect.

	Attempt to speed up indexing by less cols in indices

2009-05-20  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Improved HAL UDI lookup speed from ~5ms to 0.5ms

	Fixed indexer potential path breakage by using g_build_path instead

	Fixes indexer so we do not parse metadata text if FTS is disabled

2009-05-20  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Added --disable-detailed-metadata to NOT index less important metadata
	This simply doesn't index data like Image:Comments which is considered
	less useful than information like Image:Height, etc.

	Removed File:Ext and File:NameDelimited for performance
	The File:Ext can be obtained easily per Name anyway and the
	File:NameDelimited is simply the File:Path and File:Name added
	together so it duplicates data in the database. 

	This removal makes quite a difference on the Maemo device.

2009-05-20  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Fixes NB#110584, Image:HasKeywords working incorrectly

	Don't iterate data update context twice and quote everything

	Added dynamic pragma loader using config file

	Make HAVE_SQLITE_FTS a #define in config.h

2009-05-15  Carlos Garnacho  <carlos@lanedo.com>

	Use single DB insert statements instead of insert and many updates
	This seriously improves speed. My desktop, 7k items, 35s down to 28s.
	This patch from Carlos was based on an intitial patch by Philip Van Hoof.

2009-05-14  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Check if the sym link can be followed
	Check if a link can be followed. In some cases (.../proc/... symbolic links,
	present in chroot envs, scratchbox, etc.) link_path was NULL and caused
	a SEGFAULT in g_filename_to_utf8.

	(specially in ..../proc/... symbolic link)

2009-05-14  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Do not use default values for numeric null fields
	Instead of setting a default value for numeric fields with null content we
	just return an empty string in this case as well.

	Fixes NB#115978

	Add multivalue support for all image metadata formats
	Add support for multivalued fields in all image metadata formats and fix how
	HasKeywords is used.

	Fixes NB#110584.

2009-05-13  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fix not crawling inserted removable media
	Now we start the processor again when we get new removable media
	inserted, this bug mainly affects the condition when we have finished
	processing all files and the removable media state changes again. 

	The statistics we report about files crawled and time taken is now
	reset and correct each time this occurs.

	The mount point added and removed callbacks from HAL were removed in
	TrackerProcessor and now two functions are called FROM tracker-main.c
	which do the same thing. The reason for this, is that we change state
	while setting volume states and we can't process removable media in
	some states. So to control this we do everything AFTER we have set the
	removable media states correctly.

2009-05-13  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Bugfixes for album art heuristics

2009-05-13  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Make sure we call va_end before returning in evolution-imap module

	Check return value of important GLib calls, found by coverity

	Removed unused variables from coverity findings

	Fixed src/libstemmer/libstemmer.c coverity failures

	Fixed utils/qdbm/ print-words and search-word based on coverity

	Fixed tracker-xmp coverity findings

	Fixes to tracker-rdf-query module from coverity

	Pause indexer when setting volume states & disable TTL use
	Disable udi variable check in tracker-data-update, was causing some
	log warnings when NULL is quite acceptable.

	Disabled TTL APIs (tracker_removable_device_*) in indexer which was
	causing several bugs related to speed and caching of albumart.

	Make sure we quit the main loop in the event we have NO volumes to
	enable on startup in the daemon.

	Make sure we pause the indexer before doing ANY volume calls to ensure
	they get through when the indexer is quite busy. Any failure response
	here will shutdown the daemon so this is quite important.

2009-05-12  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Set up volume states before enabling public APIs via DBus
	In the startup for the daemon, we now make sure we free
	TrackerMainPrivate and fix a warning there. We also change the startup
	so we wait until the indexer has replied regarding setting up volumes
	before we allow users to send DBus requests in. If the indexer fails
	to reply successfully with the volumes set up, we will exit
	immediately. The reason for this, is because the SQL queries highly
	depend on the Volumes table being accurate. A restart (triggered from
	another DBus request) may well fix this anyway.

	In the daemon module, we don't get the stats when we create the
	GObject because tracker-main requests that for us AFTER we have set up
	all our public interfaces (DBus, push modules, etc).

	In the processor, we now set ->finished to FALSE when starting and we
	also check ->finished before in _stop() so we don't print processor
	summaries when we have already finished.

2009-05-12  Philip Van Hoof  <philip@codeminded.be>

	Performance improvement heurstic scan for album art
	Don't try to open files that aren't PNG files.

2009-05-11  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Check error on dbus connection
	Check the GError returned by the DBus connect method, and not only
	if connection != NULL.

	Fixes NB#115956, Tracker tools core dumps

	Add index to Volumes table
	New index for Volumes table. This speed up the GetVolumeId query in
	indexing time.

2009-05-11  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Get the actual mount point for a given path to get volume id in db
	Before we did this, we were using clever SQL statements to get the
	ID in the Volumes table based on a given path and the known volume's
	mount point in the database. This of course doesn't give a real idea
	of the mount point because you can't rely on clever string
	manipulation, only the file system really knows which removable device
	the file is on. So now we get the real device and use some extra
	caching to improve performance here too so we can get the UDI by path.
	The UDI is then looked up in the database for the volume ID.

	NOTE: This is related to and improves on NB#109892 and NB#112632.

2009-05-09  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Fix GetVolumeByPath
	There can be nested mount points (e.g. /home and /home/user/MyDocs), so we need to
	return the longest match for a certain path (e.g. /home/user/MyDocs/a.mp3 must return
	/home/user/MyDocs and not /home as result).

	Added desc sort by length to return the longest mountpoint that matches.

	Fixes NB#109892

2009-05-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes: NB#112632, Files seem to go missing from database
	Now we make sure we ALWAYS signal statistics changes when a mountable
	device's state changes. Before we were only doing this on removable
	for some reason. Now we do it when we re-mount the media again.

2009-05-08  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Off-by-one fix to the genre name mapping in mp3 extraction
	Fixes NB#113903

2009-05-08  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes: NB#110221, ML: Album Art is not displaying in All Album and...
	We were not returning strings in lowercase when stripping the names,
	this means "Bryan Adams" and "bryan adams" produce different MD5 sums
	which causes duplicates in albumart.

2009-05-07  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Add full text search optional and enabled by default

	Revert patch to use binary search with QDBM cache, was causing regressions

2009-05-07  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Fixes for the heuristic scanner

2009-05-07  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Do not free the option context a second time.

2009-05-07  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes NB#100123, Image:Date is empty for some of the images
	Always fallback to mtime for Image:Date metadata

2009-05-06  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Removed **** from low disk space messages in log

	Use gint64 not guint for binary search, array index was sometimes < 0
	The left/right/center variables used in the binary search were defined
	as guint and center which is used for the index in the array had
	rolled over to max guint after being set to a value < 0.

	Fix indexer crash, by setting ALL struct members in unindex_metadata
	We weren't setting the data.{service_id|id|index} and then using those
	in the TrackerDBIndex calls as uninitialised data.

	Fixed disk_space_check_stop() critical warning on shutdown

	Fix Valgrind errors / leaks and added public API parameter checks
	This patch removes a lot of casts which were unnecessary. It also
	fixes a memory leak and doesn't allocate memory unnecessarily in
	places. There were also reports from Valgrind about use of uninitiated
	memory which should be fixed now. Public APIs now have full variable
	checking on to throw out any erroneous calls.

	Fixed indexer invalid writes in state_to_string() if string is empty
	We assumed the string was always > 3 characters long and we always
	truncated the last 3 characters which had the separator " | " appened.

	Fixes binary search index size error, assumed 0 to array->len
	This should have been 0 to array->len - 1. This was causing READ
	errors noticed on the device as a crash finally.

2009-05-06  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Add a generic dbus method for performing aggregates on unique value queries.
	A more generic method has been added for aggregates on unique values.

2009-05-05  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Fixes: NB#114354, trackerd polls
	This was more work than I expected. I think I fixed another bug with
	the testing on this one. We now make sure that if we go back to IDLE
	state after we have finished PENDING/WATCHING states for crawling we
	correct the state to go straight back to PAUSED if we are paused for
	any of the reasons we can be paused. The bug here was that we ended up
	indexing content if we paused based on a full disk if the full disk
	state occurred BEFORE we finished crawling the file system.

	Also, we now watch the TrackerConfig low-disk-space-limit notify
	signal to update in real time.

2009-05-05  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Ensure a transaction is started right after getting metadata/text.

	Plug several memory leaks.

2009-04-27  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Add test to tracker-turtle
	Add test to tracker-turtle (coverage over 90%). Commented out the
	optimize test. It is not working fine.

2009-04-27  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Disables evolution push module and improves the code
	This patch also fixes the coding style in places and replaces some
	strchr() calls for the utf8 equivalent. Code was added to make the
	evolution plugin work. The "File:Modified" metadata was missing and
	that was the reason nothing was being added to the database.

	NOTE: We are not using this because doing so makes the indexer
	completely unresponsive. This is what is needed to actually make the
	evolution plugin feed our database.  However, there is no queueing, no
	pausing, no control at all, we simply handle everything as it comes.
	This is not good enough for tracker-0.6 because it causes a regression
	in the indexer. So this is disabled.

	NOTE: This code is supposed to be quite different in the tracker-0.7
	branch and as such it makes no sense fixing it.

2009-04-24  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Bumped version for release

	Prepare for release 0.6.94

2009-04-24  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	The test cases for extraction that require generation of test data are
	commented out so they won't fail in automated checking.

2009-04-21  Martyn Russell  <martyn@imendio.com>

	Added more information about module use to tracker-extract
	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-extract.c: Added debugging so we know
	  which modules are loaded on start up and to know which modules are
	  used to extract content on a per file basis to help when we have
	  multiple extractors handling the same mime types. 

	* src/tracker-extract/tracker-main.c: Change logging format when
	  running stand alone and not writing to a log file and don't log
	  everything, only log based on the verbosity setting.

2009-04-21  Ivan Frade  <ivan.frade@nokia.com>

	Add mock test
	A completely empty unit test file was breaking gtester report tool.

	Fix gtester report

2009-04-20  Mikael Ottela  <mikael.ottela@ixonos.com>

	Performance improvements to jpeg extraction
	We now do much less unnecessary formatting using libexif for better
	performance.

	Read mp3 files in parts in extraction
	We now read last 128 bytes for id3v1 metadata separately from mmap of the mp3
	file in mp3 extraction for better performance. We now handle large mp3 files
	without problems.

	Fixes NB#111560

2009-04-20  Carlos Garnacho  <carlosg@gnome.org>

	Fixes #578159 â Tracker starts to index when removable media is inserted, regardless of user preferences.
	* src/trackerd/tracker-processor.c (tracker_processor_stop): Set state to IDLE
