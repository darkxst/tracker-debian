tracker (0.6.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/01-version_fix.patch
    - Removed, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/02-getenv.patch
    - Removed, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/03-system_ioprio.patch
    - Removed, fixed upstream.
  * debian/control
    - Build-Depend on libqdbm-dev (again); qdbm proved to be a lot faster and
      less ressource hungy for the index databases than sqlite3.
    - Enable XMP support by adding a Build-Depends on libexempi-dev.
    - Use the new "Homepage:" field to specify the upstream URL.
  * debian/rules
    - Build against the system qdbm libray.
    - Pass "-Wl,-Bsymbolic" to LDFLAGS. This will avoid namespace conflicts
      which can lead to all kinds of subtle bugs in clients that load
      libtrackerclient via dlopen. Closes: #443824

      Patch by dann frazier, thanks. Closes: #440997

tracker (0.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/10-function_prototypes.patch
    - Removed, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/01-version_fix.patch
    - Fix the version number shown at trackerd start.
  * debian/control
    - Drop Build-Depends on libqdbm-dev. Tracker now uses sqlite3 for all of
      its databases.
    - Bump Build-Depends on libsqlite3-dev to >= 3.4 as the new sqlite based
      indexer requires the incremental blob I/0 feature of sqlite 3.4.
  * debian/rules
    - Add --enable-deskbar-applet=handler to DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS.
      deskbar-applet in unstable still uses the "old-style" handler interface.
    - Drop --enable-external-sqlite and --enable-external-qdbm from
      DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS. These configure options are now obsolete.
